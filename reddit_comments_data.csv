Moons have a perfect self regulatory mechanism removing sell pressure burning more at lower prices.

Comment,1jc8re6,Due-Inspection-5660,1742093600.0,"If you analyse recent comments by US Treasury Sectary Scott Bessent and comments made by Canadian officials after their meeting with the Trump admin in washington last week, you can see that it's very likely Trump wants to agree a deal with ALL COUNTRIES for tariffs to be scaled back, except in a few critical industries like steel and aluminimum.

So I think buying more Bitcoin now and waiting for them to announce a deal over the next few days and weeks is a no-brainer. Once these tariffs get rolled back, Bitcoin is easily going back over 100k almost immediately.

And there are countless other bullish catalysts in play.... it's possible BTC will be over 130k before the end of April.",8,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jc8re6/daily_crypto_discussion_march_16_2025_gmt0/

Comment,1jc8re6,qldvaper88,1742088303.0,"Easiest way is to find a 'centralised exchange'. Many of them. You create an account, send real money to the exchange through a debit card transaction or something of the like. Then you can buy the coin of your choice and it will go to the wallet that is included with your centralised exchange account. You can then send that crypto to another wallet of your choosing, generally a hardware wallet like trezor or ledger is advised, because they allow you to have a wallet where the seed phrase is never inputed onto a PC/phone which is paramount for security in this day and age where hackers are rampant.

When you want to sell, send crypto back to the exchange and you can sell it back to them for fiat currency. If you aren't looking at long term investment or large amounts of crypto, a hardware wallet isn't a necessity (in fact it never is). Fwiw, any wallet that isn't a hardware wallet is referred to as a 'hot wallet' .",5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jc8re6/daily_crypto_discussion_march_16_2025_gmt0/

People don’t understand that institutions hoarding btc ≠ centralization. The fed = centralization. Centralization of the printing mechanism itself. Btc still has tens to hundreds of thousands of individual decentralized actors mining btc, who then sell it to the people who hoard it at market price.


Also realistically, 2.3% of total supply is peanuts compared to how much of the total supply of USD is held and controlled by a handful of individuals, corporations, and the whim of the fed.

If we get closer to any one actor owning 50% of total supply then we can sound the alarm bells",24,0,https://i.redd.it/ve2i53r7wxoe1.jpeg

But if you look into it Saylor *does* own 10% of MSTR, and since his shares have 10x voting rights he actually has 45% of voting power of the company. So, along with the top seat, he does control a lot. He also said he had 20,000 coins personally in 2021. I would not be surprised to learn he has doubled or even tenfolded that last 4 years. So his personal wallet is likely quite relevant aswell.

Do you not know what inflation is? There is no devaluation as related to fiat, bitcoin is an asset which costs money more money every year when fiat gets inflated, bitcoin is deflationary, you are convoluting it thinking bitcoin has anything to do with cash that way.

Bitcoin has never been ""dependant"" on the larger market, ever, you literally have no idea what you are talking about. The fact that snp100 companies are now required to hold a % of their portfolio in bitcoin related stocks means that its capitulating to require bitcoin, so you literally have it backwards.

The markets are correlated, not dependant, and like anything as it grows they break free when they are worth enough, bitcoin is less tied to tech now more than ever as it becomes a reserve in most states, buisnesses, countries and etc. 

Dont understand the backwards mindset you people have, but its why i make money.

Comment,1jcje45,DBRiMatt,1742124773.0,"> It's worth noting that every previous bull run has featured multiple corrections of 30-40% before reaching the actual market top.

This is what I'm counting on.

I'm confident BTC will not only return to 100k, but break a new ATH, so, to accumulate more again at 80k feels like a good range to resume accumulating.",8,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jcje45/is_the_bullrun_over_a_historical_risk_analysis/

Comment,1jcje45,AlexWasTakenWasTaken,1742126979.0,Well yes it's called dynamic DCA. Or DCA based on risk. For example a dynamic dca strategy started in 2022 until today has 290% profits compared to a regular DCA strategy (200% profits). I just pulled these numbers off alphasquared. It's a no brainer to do dynamic dca instead. For example I haven't purchased at 100k and above because risk was too high for my strategy. Now I've started putting the money I saved during the tops into these corrections. Sure it's a bit more effort but not that much. And I don't know any other strategy that actually works better than DCA except for this.,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jcje45/is_the_bullrun_over_a_historical_risk_analysis/

Comment,1jcghib,coinfeeds-bot,1742112610.0,"tldr; Donald Trump’s crypto investment firm, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), has incurred significant losses, with its Ethereum holdings alone down $88 million. WLFI had purchased 67,880 ETH at an average price of $3,240 per token, but with Ethereum now around $2,000, the holdings are worth $132 million. The firm’s total portfolio has shrunk from $336 million to $226 million, reflecting a $110 million loss. Despite this, WLFI continues to invest in cryptocurrencies and has partnered with blockchain project Sui to explore new opportunities.

Comment,1jc5cue,coinfeeds-bot,1742073610.0,"tldr; President Donald Trump announced a 'decisive and powerful' military action against Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi movement, targeting their bases, leaders, and missile defenses. The move aims to protect American assets and restore navigational freedom in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, where Houthi attacks have disrupted shipping and raised costs. Trump criticized the Biden administration's earlier delisting of the Houthis as a terrorist group and warned Iran against supporting them. The strikes mark the most significant military action of Trump's second term.
