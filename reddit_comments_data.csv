Comment,1jgvevi,Consistent-Beyond129,1742614793.0,"What will be the top signal that alt bull has started? 
I was on and off crypto since 2021 but have been tracking daily since last February. At that time, the prices would rise at asia waking up, then correct a bit, again rise at europe waking up , slight correction and then rise at burger waking up and slight correction. There was absolutely no relation with stock market. It just kept rising. This happened till almost april. Unlike last nov-dec when random coins hit 500% in little time then to correct back sharply.

With quantum computing advancements accelerating, I'm curious how many of you are seriously considering quantum-resistant cryptos in your portfolios. Projects like Algorand, Hedera, and Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) are actively working on post-quantum security, but is this truly a concern for most investors yet—or still just futuristic hype?

Comment,1jgvevi,Preme2,1742623152.0,"You know, I thought about this even when Bitcoin was at 110k and alts were making some moves. My portfolio was the highest it’s ever been, but I still couldn’t buy anything. Homes are unaffordable, cars are expensive and will rapidly depreciate. I could spent the money on a nice vacation, but did I really spend years and invest a good amount for vacations? I could do that without crypto. 

You’re right, my net worth was increasing but I was stuck in no mans land because I couldn’t convert my paper gains into real world gains because everything is expensive. 

I have come to consider, that maybe the economy going down, leading bitcoin lower and alts going even lower really is the only way to get QE back. Once that happens I suspect alts will outperform and attain those “life changing” gains. 

The people around during the pandemic had to watch their portfolio get cut in half overnight. Alts went to zero.

Ouch. ETH is down more than SOL if you go by the previous bull run ATHs. If ETH goes back to $2,417.62 and SOL stays where it's at, then ETH will have dropped as much as SOL. That shows you how badly ETH has performed.

The proposal aims to be budget-neutral and modernize the nation's asset portfolio. While still in the exploratory phase, the concept reflects growing acceptance of cryptocurrency at high levels of government, though no decisions have been finalized.

Comment,1jgevh5,critiqueextension,1742568222.0,"On March 21, 2000, Michael Saylor lost an unprecedented $6 billion in a single day due to a massive plummet in MicroStrategy's stock, which fell nearly 62% after the company had to restate its financial results, turning past profits into losses. This colossal loss remains one of the largest personal financial declines in history and significantly altered Saylor's trajectory in the tech industry, as he later shifted focus towards Bitcoin investments, which also saw dramatic fluctuations in value over the years.

His non-liquid net worth was reduced by 6 billion, but loss implies realization not you know literally nothing of consequence because the company didn't go under, he didn't sell off the stock, etc etc.  He didn't realize a very temporary spike in the share price, which means he possibly missed out on 6 billion, but that is not a loss.

He's now taken Microstrategy, a low level software player, and completely engineered their current scheme around bitcoin.  Basically using bitcoin to take out loans to buy more bitcoin to take more loans out.  The system depends on bitcoin continually rising over years, which I believe is why his predictions are becoming more lofty and he is shilling it harder than ever.  His last prediction was something like 13 million per bitcoin in 15 years.

I definitely see a distinct possibility of a price drop in bitcoin leading to microstrategy imploding and pulling the entire crypto market down and probably impacting the larger market as a whole too.

Those are the only 2 options, because Saylor can't sell a small amount of  the bitcoin ever, the moment MSTR is forced to sell BTC. It will be like blood in the water to traders to short BTC because they know a massive sell order is coming and it will create a vicious cycle of MSTR forcing to sell more BTC to cover its current liabilities.

The market is charging MSTR more and more interest to give Saylor capital in smaller and smaller amounts. 

The preferred share offering that just got priced today at a 15% discount will raise $711 million dollars. 

Assuming they hold back a years worth of dividend payments for their preferred shares that leaves $568 million in capital to buy BTC with. 

At $84k btc price they could acquire 6760 btc total.

This is a really tough one. We are dealing with an insane amount of denial with literally over 1.6 Trillion USD worth of value at stake. Even more if we factor in, going down the list of POW coins, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum Classic, Kaspa etc. Note: There are two POW coins that  I have skipped above because they do not have this issue. Dogecoin and Monero.

1) Dogecoin. This coin was conceived as a joke and it's emission was intended to abruptly stop after 6 months. It was literally designed to fail. A bug in the code led to the constant emission continuing in perpetuity. In an interesting  way the ""joke"" is turning out to be on Bitcoin and similar coins with falling block rewards. 

2) Monero. Here the decision to have a constant or ""tail"" emission was a very deliberate part of the social covenant going back to 2014 when Monero was launched. The rate was deliberately chosen to be less than 1% of the total supply. The idea was a rate of growth in the money supply just below the historical growth of the gold money supply. This makes Monero a harder form of money than gold, thereby exceeding the Austrian economics standard for hard money. The perpetual emission rate has been 0.6 XMR per 2 min block which is roughly equivalent to stopping the Bitcoin halving at the current 3.125 XBT per 10 min block.

Edit: There are many people, like myself, in the Monero community that understand this issue very well, but more often than not we hide behind a cloak of privacy, Pardon the pun!",4,0,https://i.redd.it/404390tq51qe1.png

> *""Bitcoin, because to me it seems like it's nothing more than a pet rock.""*

> It's always BTC parabolic gains seeking profits and attracting attention and capital to the crypto space is the cause of appreciation. ETH is a Network Utility Token. That is all ETH is. It's competing with a many competing network utility tokens and many networks and L2s. These networks are increasingly going to be rails for stablecoins and such (97% of RWA are just stablecoins) and in order for the network to remain competitive they need to remain cheap. ETH is utility of being a rail for tokenized assets doesn't give it a $500 Billion marketcap -- ETHs value is derived from the money and investors that the pet rock brings.

Comment,1jgjkaz,punishGoalhanging,1742598578.0,"Cryptocom is double dipping on selling the none-purchased crypto

1)  Fees as an exchange 

2) Coin Founders (selling unlocked coins)


---------------------------

**36 billion USD: my educated guess of the amount of none-purchased crypto that miners, exchanges, hackers, coin founders (unlock coins), governments have sold in the past 12 months**

I had an argue with a friend recently about the amount of none-purchased crypto that have been sold in the past 12 months. Did some research by quick googling.

Exchanges selling: I am guessing maybe around $15 billion a year

Miners selling: I am guessing maybe around $10 billion a year

Founder selling unlocked coins: I am guessing maybe $8 billion a year

Hackers selling: I am guessing maybe $2 billion a year

Government selling confiscated coins: I am guessing maybe $1 billion a year

Some sources to back up my guess:

Exchanges selling some of the crypto they got in fees:

Quick google search....coinbase annual revenue is $6.6 billion.

Binance 2022 annual revenue is $12 billion.

etc....

A lot of the exchange revenues are from selling none-purchased crypto.

**Founders selling unlocked coins. Founders selling some of these none-purchased coins**

$3.46 billion in crypto tokens to be unlocked in October 2024

November 2024 will see $2.6 billion worth of crypto tokens unlocked across major blockchain projects, including Sui, Aptos, Arbitrum, and more. These releases will affect market liquidity and token values.

December 2024 will see $5.08 billion worth of tokens unlocked, with $1.99 billion classified as cliff unlocks. Major projects include Jito, Cardano, Aptos, Sui, Arbitrum, and Optimism. Token unlocks could increase market volatility and present buying opportunities.

Jan 15, 2025 — According to CryptoRank, a research and analytics platform focused on crypto data, January will see around $7.2 billion in crypto token unlocks.

In February 2025, the market is set for over $3.13B in token unlocks from major projects like XRP, SUI, JTO, GAL, TAI, and NTRN which could change liquidity levels and influence price trends.

Even cryptodotcom recently vote to ""unlock"" 70billion CRO over a span of 5 years (about $5 billion USD).

Thoughts on my $36 billion figure? Too high estimate? Too low estimate?

Comment,1jgpm9a,coinfeeds-bot,1742586629.0,"tldr; Matt Hougan, CIO of Bitwise Asset Management, predicts Bitcoin will surpass gold and reach $1 million per coin by 2029 due to institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and demand outpacing supply. He highlights the impact of Bitcoin ETFs, stablecoin growth, and corporate interest as key drivers. Hougan also notes bipartisan support for crypto legislation and Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against economic uncertainty. He believes Bitcoin's finite supply and increasing institutional demand will continue to push its price upward.

Comment,1jgpm9a,Numerous_Wonders81,1742628945.0,"Algorand, on the other hand, utilizes Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS), which offers instant finality, no forks, and consistent security without volatility or large staking pools controlling governance. Unlike Ethereum, Algorand's staking doesn't encourage centralization because there's no incentive to pool resources into centralized staking services.

Additionally, Algorand's economic security is inherently stable because it relies on cryptographic consensus rather than computational power or staking dominance. This ensures robust security without the volatility of Bitcoin's hashrate or the centralization risks that Ethereum faces.

In a truly rational market, these fundamental strengths—decentralization, security, stability, and scalability—would put Algorand’s economic security at least on par with Ethereum's, and arguably even ahead.

Gold is a storage for wealth, it is also used industrially,  though,  it does not grow in value at the rate it should.   The lack of new deposits being profitable to mine,  recycling becoming the ""new mining technique "" are skewing the value.   

I'm no genius or even an expert.   I do think Gold is undervalued by about 33-50%.  The tech sector is going to start chewing through Gold and Silver rapidly the deeper we get with microelectronics.   Especially when a huge push for robotic factories starts rolling.   

For BTC, it's the new kid on the block,  it is rapidly finding is Niche!  It has surpassed gold in the storage of value rapidly!   And it's use case is evolving daily.   To what end,  who knows yet.  Will layer3 technology use the blockchain to control the physical gold used in the hardware sector?   In the end,  they will work hand in hand industrially!

Every single sub on this shitty website is dedicated to fanboys. If you go onto the Costco sub and bring up legit criticism of Costco, you’re getting downvoted. If you go onto Bogleheads and shit on ETFs (specifically VOO, VTI, or VT), you’re getting downvoted. If you onto Politics or WorldNews or News and don’t shit on Trump, you’re getting downvoted.

And so on and so on and so on.

This is the only subreddit I’m aware of where you go in and there’s usually less than 10 comments even on popular topics, and half the comments are shitting on crypto. 

Why? I’ll tell you why. Because pro crypto people have given up on this subreddit following all the bullshit with Moons, bad advice on altcoins, constant cheerleading, all the manipulation, bots, etc.

So when I get downvoted I see it as a badge of honor. The assholes who post here don’t like that I’m on a crypto subreddit being pro crypto and anti manipulation. If you want to cheerlead gold I think you should fuck off and go to the gold subreddit to circlejerk like the rest of reddit does in their safe spaces.

Tornado Cash, a decentralized protocol enhancing Ethereum transaction privacy, was sanctioned in 2022 over alleged misuse by bad actors. A 2025 court ruling deemed its autonomous smart contracts immune to sanctions. The US Treasury remains vigilant against misuse by groups like North Korea's Lazarus Group.

Comment,1jg4e96,thinkingperson,1742536727.0,">If we do the math: 31,587,682 \* 27.6439 = 873.2M CRO was set aside for Monaco holders if everyone claimed (they didn't) - and Cro has a total supply of 100B tokens.

I am still upset with Kris for the 70b unburn ... but in the case of Monaco > Cro, the fact that Monaco holders did not claim their cro airdrop, it is not the fault of CDC. <--- this is still valid

873.2M CRO is supposed to belong to monaco holders, leaving CDC with ~~126.8M cro~~ **99,126.8M CRO. <--- updated**

I would presume that CDC had Monaco coins as well, so they would also get some in the process.

>Or in other words [crypto.com](http://crypto.com) stole 99.127% of the supply of the new token from existing Monaco holders on the forced swap to CRO.

~~To conclude as a result, that CDC stole 99.127% of the supply is disingenuous and distorting the facts.~~ 

**I have to concede that op makes a valid point with CDC diluting the value held by Monaco holders by inflating the coin supply with an additional 99.127%**. But I am still uncomfy with calling it ""stealing"". Semantics, I know, but I like to call it what it is.

I don't like what Kris is doing but ~~distorting facts~~ **calling it ""stealing""** just to vilify Kris/CDC more is no better.

Calling the Monaco fiasco ""**value dilution**"" or ""**supply inflation**"" by minting an additional 99.127% of CRO in the Monaco -> CRO coin conversion, and would better parallel what CDC has just done, another ""value dilution"" / ""supply inflation"" by unminting 70b cro.

I have no quarrels with op, only with Kris / CDC. Fuck them and their money printer. Worse than the Feds if you ask me.",8,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jg4e96/the_first_cryptocom_scam_was_worse_than_you/

Comment,1jg4e96,biba8163,1742580429.0,"I've been saying it for years, Crypto.com and FTX have the same business model:

> Crypto.com and FTX similarities:

> - Both are reckless rapid hyper growth exchanges that didn't exist until a few years ago. FTX started in 2019 and Crypto.com went into BETA in 2020

> - Both exchanges seemingly pulled money out of thin air with massive marketing buying naming rights to stadiums (FTX arena, Crypto.com arena) and sports sponsorship deals

> - Both spent huge amounts of money employing movie starts, superstar athletes, spending millions of dollars on commercials

> - Both of these exchanges have their own token printed out of thin air and pumped and dumped on naive investors to fuel their reckless growth and spending spree.

> Now there is no transparency into if crypto.com leveraged their token to inflate their balance sheet and get loans or ran leveraged hedge fund alongside the exchange but we know crypto.com reckless spent money they did not have on massive marketing campaigns and unsustainable rewards programs to lure new and naive crypto noobs to the exchange and its token only to cut rewards again and again and again to nothing and dump the manipulated token to a fraction of its value. We also know that the founder has a shady past of running multiple failed companies before he entered crypto and then rug pulling investors in his first crypto project before creating crypto.com.  

> So if it walks like a scam, talks like a scam, you don't need 100% proof that it's a shady shitcoin and scam exchange.  Every project people raise red flags about ended up scamming people and going down.  And people here have repeatedly been warned about crypto.com over the years

Comment,1jg4e96,GabeSter,1742519078.0,"I'm no legal expert but I would think there are three separate cases against CDC

Credit Card holders would probably have a case. CDC largely sold them a token to lock up for one year at no cost to themselves, marketing it with great rewards that CDC knew weren't sustainable. They then proceeded to nuke the rewards causing the token to crash and everyone they tricked into buying the token and locking up for the rewards lost a lot of money.

I would think Monaco holders also have a case considering CDC devalued the relative share of their investment by over 99%,

Now everyone who got scammed by Kris on the CRO remint probably also has a case.

Comment,1jgtek5,coinfeeds-bot,1742597405.0,"tldr; Bitcoin is under pressure as large holders, or whales, increase exchange activity, with the Bitcoin Exchange Whale Ratio reaching levels not seen since last year. This suggests potential sell-side activity, which could lead to price corrections. Investor sentiment has also declined sharply, returning to levels seen before Bitcoin's last major rally. Analysts believe institutional interest and long-term investors are crucial for breaking the current sideways market action, as ETFs recently registered $700 million in inflows after a streak of outflows.

Comment,1jgbrw3,coinfeeds-bot,1742544603.0,"tldr; Ether's supply on crypto exchanges has dropped to its lowest level since November 2015, with balances 16.4% lower than in January, according to Santiment. This trend suggests investors are moving ETH to cold storage for long-term holding, potentially signaling a supply shock and price surge if demand remains strong. Some analysts predict ETH could reach $8,000–$10,000. However, ETH's performance against Bitcoin is at a five-year low, and it has dropped 26% in the past month, trading at $1,971 as of now.

Comment,1jgbrw3,datbackup,1742551547.0,"1. Arbitrage: If the liquidity on a given exchange gets so low that price will move so easily, arbitrageurs will move liquidity from other more liquid exchanges to the less liquid one in order to profit from the inevitable price gaps that come with illiquidity.

2. Market makers are not withdrawing their ETH from exchanges. Users may be, but the whole idea behind being a market maker is you get paid to leave your liquidity on the exchange so people can buy and sell without moving the price too much.

If all (non-market-maker) users withdrew their ETH it would probably have some impact on liquidity, but if that impact were large enough to be worth mentioning, then either 1) would occur, or 2) it would mean the market makers were failing to do their jobs and/or the exchange was insolvent.

Comment,1jfsyb6,GabeSter,1742489016.0,"For those that don't know Crypto.Com has scammed their users on at least three separate occasions including the most recent scam they pulled on CRO holders.

1. The first was using their ICO holders funds to jumpstart their business before screwing over the ICO holders and later abandoning their ICO coin and converting Monaco to cryptocom Coin, where Monaco holders were given a fraction of the market share of their old token in the new coin.
2. The second was when they were the main seller of CRO to people wanting to get Credit Cards, before they gutted the credit card rewards because the initial rewards were unsustainable. Causing the credit card rewards to be essentially useless and simultaneously destroying the value of CRO they had dumped on those users.
3. The third and most recent scam was when they burned 70B CRO in 2021 and just independently passed a proposal to remint the 70B burnt CRO changing the circulating supply from 30B to 100B (an increase of 233%), and then gave all 70B to themselves (currently worth $5B) to cover ""their future expenses"".

You can read a more in depth breakdown of how all the scams went down on this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jec87g/cryptocom\_just\_scammed\_their\_users\_again\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jec87g/cryptocom_just_scammed_their_users_again_and/)

Comment,1jfsxuw,JollyPicklePants1969,1742575574.0,"According to ChatGPT, over the past 20 years, according to McKinsey, the global balance sheet has grown at a CAGR of 5.65%.  Assuming the same CAGR stays the same, we’re talking about a 1.2 quadrillion market cap - so Bitcoin is 22% instead of 10%.  If you believe in a world where pension funds hold Bitcoin, sovereigns hold Bitcoin in reserve, speculative real estate investment has shifted in size to Bitcoin, and large oil transactions are conducted in Bitcoin by entities who would like to bypass the dollar, this is not an unreasonable projection. 

Even if Saylor is overtalking his book, even a 2,000,000 Bitcoin price would be a 17.1% CAGR at todays prices.  A 25% CAGR over 20 years would put Bitcoin at $7.4m.  Either of those outcomes absolutely crush the S&P 500’s historical return.

Don’t get me wrong, I still think there are sizable risks to be considered including quantum computing and the sustainability of blockchain rewards for miners.  But the risk/reward at these levels does not seem half bad to me and I don’t see why any reasonable investor should object to a 5% Bitcoin allocation in their portfolio.",1,0,https://www.thestreet.com/crypto/markets/bitcoin-will-go-to-13-million-over-20-years-says-bullish-michael-saylor

Comment,1jg27t0,coinfeeds-bot,1742511607.0,"tldr; Tether has purchased over $33 billion in US Treasury bonds, making it the seventh-largest buyer, surpassing countries like Canada and Germany. This move aligns with potential US stablecoin regulations, such as the GENIUS Act, which requires reserve assets in US Treasuries. President Trump suggested stablecoins could boost dollar dominance, positioning Tether as a key player. However, Tether still faces regulatory hurdles, including the need for third-party audits, which could impact its compliance and future partnerships with the US government.

Comment,1jfw1lh,Dogs_Pics_Tech_Lift,1742500255.0,"You know what the issue with this is though. 

You have two options buy physical gold or buy a gold ETF (this is a simple example). 

If you buy physical gold and the police search you they confiscate it and say if you can’t verify where it came from we assume it’s illegal and confiscate it which happens all the time. If you buy an ETF then it’s really no different than BTC. 

So I’d rather put my money into crypto where I can just tell the police I lost my seed phrase and they can’t just seize my assets. 

There was a news article within the last few years where a 20 year old had been buying gold with his money. He was driving slowly because he was transporting 200k in gold and the police stopped him for going 5 under the speed limit (which is an illegal stop) and then illegally searched his car because it was suspicious to drive slow. They took all his gold and the court ruled unless he could prove where it came from he couldn’t get it back. No idea what happened after that but they couldn’t do that if it was crypto BTC or whatever!",2,0,https://i.redd.it/a5szw7zq2wpe1.png

Comment,1jgiknc,coinfeeds-bot,1742568607.0,"tldr; KULR Technology Group announced a Bitcoin Treasury strategy in late 2024, allocating up to 90% of its excess cash reserves into Bitcoin. By February 2025, the company had invested approximately $60 million, acquiring 610 BTC at an average price of $98,000 per BTC. KULR partnered with Coinbase Prime for secure custody. The move sparked a significant rally in KULR's stock price but also drew criticism for exposing the company to cryptocurrency volatility and shareholder dilution. KULR views Bitcoin as a long-term asset to enhance financial stability and shareholder value.

Comment,1jfru9j,MVazovski,1742495158.0,"It is just so sad that crypto was about ""It's time for a change, it's time to get rid of central banks, centralized assets which we can't control! Time to take the matter into our own hands! Buy bitcoin!"" and nowadays it's about  ""Orange Man pls promote bitcoin pls mister Sailor, mister real life manbat pls someone talk about bitcoin so I can get rich pls""

It is just sad to see it came to this. I remember there was this one guy who insulted me like ""oh yeah??? You said it will go down and Bitcoin just hit another ATH of 109k! You were WRONG!!!!!"" I wonder what happened to him lol. In the long term, it will go up (I guess?) but it's safe to say a lot of people are left holding the bags, a lot of people bought for 100k+, most likely with the money they needed and now are waiting to break even or have sold at a loss.

Also, I won't talk about politics but here's a very hard to swallow pill: No matter what the Orange Man does, he will ALWAYS do what benefits him. He lowers the price of bitcoin by causing constant fear all the way down to 20k to buy hundreds of millions of dollars worth of it? You can bet your ass he will. He already has but needs a quick pump? He will go on and talk about solid things like government buying bitcoin and whatnot.

- Appointed Mark Uyeda, a pro-crypto SEC commissioner, as acting head of the SEC.

- Promoted Hester Pierce, the other pro-crypto SEC commissioner and a powerful dissenting voice against the Gensler SEC decisions during the Biden administration.

- Appointed Bessent, Atkins and Lutnick, all pro-crypto people, into top agency positions.

- Put all government Bitcoin in a Strategic Reserve with plans to acquire more, firmly establishing Bitcoin as an asset of global importance, and signaling that the government intends to treat it as a serious reserve asset.

- Met with top crypto people in a roundtable, to discuss tokenization and stablecoins.

- Appointed David Sacks as ""crypto czar"", a role specifically designed to oversee and encourage digital asset adoption and innovation in the US.

- Empowered Cynthia Lummis to investigate Operation Choke Point 2.0, which was the Biden era backdoor regulatory war against crypto builders, that culminated in mass debanking of law abiding citizens and the shutdown of banks that provided financial rails to crypto businesses.

- Saw that the SEC charges/Wells Notices against Coinbase, Uniswap etc have all been dropped.

- The entire admin speaks openly about wanting to promote and support digital asset innovation. Sergey Nazarov of Chainlink said on Bloomberg that the current administration is infinitely more open and easy to work with than the previous one.

- Rescinded the IRS broker rule, which made DeFi front ends ""brokers"" and basically crushed public DeFi

- Rescinded the OCC guidance that banks can't perform cryptocurrency activities

The crypto market did actually experience a significant boost since Trump won the election. Although it is true that most of his actions did not directly benefit the space, it is factually correct that the result of the elections was the turning point in this cycle.

After all, he has been the US president or candidate who spoke in the most positive way about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.
In terms of policies, most statements are not relevant, but this is the first attempt implemented by the US Government to actually build a crypto reserve with a long term intention, and some acts seemed quite effective, like removing Gensler from the SEC and appointing a more crypto friendly officer.

Please note that I do not like XRP and do not see the point of investing in it as a payment token, so the SEC dropping the Ripple case was not an outcome I was looking for in any way.

I just want to understand why this sentiment.

Comment,1jfobs4,AnoAnoSaPwet,1742521366.0,"The CPI is based on a yearly rolling average, it's not really a good representation of the market. It's not even in relation to Cost of Living? It's based on commercial/industrial markets.

Comment,1jfobs4,AnoAnoSaPwet,1742574440.0,"Thanks for clarifying. Appreciate it.


High inflation + low rates = economy damage


I honestly would not be surprised if interest rates skyrocket globally?


I saw a warning from the Bank of Canada today that they are most likely going to be ramping rates up in the future despite economic easing being in the cards. 


I have a renewal in June, and chances are it's better to just not even make an effort to refinance because of how extremely uncertain the economic outlook is?


That's how bad this economic policy is: you can't even plan for it. ",1,0,https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/bitcoin-price-forecast-btc-hovers-above-85-500-as-trump-calls-the-fed-to-lower-interest-rates-202503201029

Comment,1jg3nbq,fan_of_hakiksexydays,1742567639.0,"If I were a bear right now, I would be increasingly nervous about having short positions in either stocks or crypto.

The bear case depends too much on what happens with tariffs and hoping for more of the same fear.

Tariffs that could end up being renegotiated, only partial, delayed or be gone.

Or at the very least, have the uncertainty removed.

Even if they don't get renegotiated, there's only so much of the same fear that can keep moving the price, and sooner or later gets exhausted, be old news, and have too much of it already priced in. Or the market might actually believe the Fed and brush it off as transitory.

But if I was a bear right now, I'd have to put all my trust in Trump to be a man of his word and go through with his April 2nd tariffs, and at the same time, the market continue to panic over the same tariffs and consequences that it has known about for weeks.",10,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jg3nbq/daily_crypto_discussion_march_21_2025_gmt0/

RemindMe! 5 years

Remind me that the scam token LINK will be lower in 2030 than it was in 2020 when it reached ~$20.  People will be mocking bagholders for investing in a meme like Decentralized Oracles.

All the ChainLink scam does is a centralized shitcoin price feeds for shitcoin casinos.  Like Ripple, ChainLink does hypes up partnership to and create lots of hype luring more gullible noobs. If you look up Sergey Nazarov, he's a typical crypo scammer who hasn't worked a day in his life.

LINK for the past few years has been shilling some pilot where Swift messages can be sent to multiple blockchains and the transactions are acknowledged very similar to the pilots Ripple does often times paying companies like Moneygram.  These are pilots that no financial institutions use and no institutions pay for LINK to justify a meme token d dump like LINK a $10 Billion marketcap 

- How many hundreds of millions of revenue does ChainLink collect from financial institutions?!  ZERO

- How many hundreds of millions of investment does ChainLink get from financial institutions?! ZERO

- Where does ChainLink get all their money to do these useless pilot programs that are solutions looking for a problem?! BAGHOLDERS

And Bagholders are acting like Swift is some huge multi-national trillion dollar marketcap company.  Swift is a bank messaging platform run by a Cooperative of 3,000 employees.  Chainlink is a typical crypto scam like many that partnered with traditional real world companies to shill their tokens for fictional vaporware use cases.  The only source of revenue has been 300 Million tokens dumped on bagholders since 2020 and the price is down -27% in 5 years.",4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jg3nbq/daily_crypto_discussion_march_21_2025_gmt0/

Comment,1jg3nbq,biba8163,1742565385.0,"~4 Years ago in November 9, 2021 when we were at the tippity top of the last cycle /r/cc  says the market melt-up hasn't even started yet and there was going to be a huge Alt Season at the end of 2021 to January 2022 just like end of 2017 to January 2018.

*I am just posting the these threads to show /r/cc is always wrong about timing the cycles but people will always post that they bought the bottoms and sold the tops with Alts and they made way more money than investing in BTC and to listen to them because they the blueprint to the cycles and it's just playing out like last time.*

> | ETH        |          $4,700|      

> - We haven't seen the real euphoria phase of this bull run yet.

> - Look at the 2014 bull run..then 2017... we haven't seen the real ride yet. The real 'blow-off top' I personally will get excited when I see vertical walls of green, walls that you need freaking climbing gear to get on top of those walls.

> - Bullruns end in euphoria I agree 100%.

> - I am totally agree with you. I think we are starting.  Get ready 

> - Agreed. Every other bull run had weeks of crazy +30% kind of days and it felt like every day you didn’t throw in your life savings was throwing away free money. This has just been a fairly steady climb up in comparison.

> - Great post! I always enjoy seeing these historical charts and comparing previous bull runs. I first got into crypto during the 2017 bull run, so it’s neat to see how things look this time around vs back then

> - Tell me when we reach the peak so I can buy high and sell low.


> - *""However, we are clearly already there...""* I don’t feel my legs tremble yet, trust me when btc hits 100k shit is gonna get wild.  We haven’t seen nothing yet.

> - Couldn't agree with you more. I feel the current 200k predictions are really a minimum of where we will get to

> - Rlly curious if it's coming. Hopefully yes. Diamond hands!

> - Thank you for posting this. I’m not selling!!

> - Worth noting that while previous runs are always used as indicators. This isn’t set in stone and it’s possibly dangerous to lead people to believe that these past indicators are a definite sign of what is coming. Unpopular opinion: I would expect a downturn by EOY.

> - Maybe this bullrun's version of euphoria is everyone saying ""We haven't hit euphoria yet so we have a long way to go."" There is a euphoria in believing the cycle is still early forever.

even if we remove the tariff situation entirely for the sake of argument, i think they are a lot of signals that we're exhausted for a while, if we haven't seen the top already

* trump launching two memecoins
* argentina president promoting a memecoin
* central african republic launching a memecoin
* ronaldinho launching a memecoin
* hawk tuah launching a memecoin
* many other B-list celebrities coming out of the woodwork to say they're getting into crypto and immediately launching memecoins
* etfs filed for random shitcoins (e.g. bonk, trump, pengu)
* fortnite pros joining crypto and making millions in 2-3 months
* hundreds of large accounts on twitter hacked to promote memecoins, often to non-crypto audiences

let me stress that point again: THREE PRESIDENTS promoted memecoins in the past few months

none of this is stuff that happens early in the cycle. remember when paris hilton and jimmy fallon were talking about their bored apes? or when kim kardashian and floyd mayweather were promoting EMAX?

fartcoin went from 0 to $2.5 billion marketcap in 3 months and was talked about all over tradfi, cnbc, nbc, stephen colbert, etc. FARTCOIN..

you could argue that this is all memecoin related and doesn't relate to btc, but it is indicative of how much hype there is around crypto right now. memecoins are the shitcoins or nfts of this cycle. this is what a lot of new people are buying and then they immediately lose all their money and don't come back. and for the people that buy bitcoin through etfs, that money no longer flows down to alts like it used to

yeah but what about all the institutions? the institutions don't care if bitcoin goes up or down, they make fees either way

what is the next narrative? what good news are we waiting for for crypto that hasn't already come out? who is still waiting to buy crypto when we have the president and his family shilling it, the federal government saying they're not selling, states proposing bills to buy bitcoin, and anyone can easily and safely buy bitcoin through an etf?",4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jg3nbq/daily_crypto_discussion_march_21_2025_gmt0/

And we're still here! That said, I do honestly think that people here are underestimating just how devastating Trump's presidency can still be to crypto, and the economy en masse.

Comment,1jflc4d,Django_McFly,1742470612.0,"I supreme up for CDC because of the credit cards.

That seemed like a scam to me so I never actually used my account once it got cleared.

Anyways, I try not to trade on exchanges.  If there's any way to get something in defi and/or and I can use the exchange to bridge, like how Coinbase years cbBTC 1:1 with actual BTC, I go that route.  If I wanted to buy Solana, I'd buy USDC for minimal/no fee, send that to my Solana wallet then swap for SOL na DEX.  Every CEX is going to charge me a trading fee ON TOP OF a spread.

Terrified, the hunter chooses the latter. Humiliated, he limps back home but is determined to get revenge. He buys a bigger gun, returns to the woods the next day, and starts hunting again.

Sure enough, he feels another tap on his shoulder. It’s the same bear. “You know the deal,” the bear says. Once again, the hunter submits.

Now furious, the hunter buys an even bigger rifle and storms into the woods, vowing to kill that bear once and for all.

He sets up, aims carefully, and just as he’s about to pull the trigger, he feels that familiar tap on his shoulder. The bear sighs and says, “Let’s be honest… you’re not really here for the hunting, are you?”

Seriously, every single person trading stocks and crypto (whichever is your degen) should spend a minute asking Google: how to pay 0 fees on Y and Z exchanges. They all have something better than the shitty default menu for spot trading, for example, that is designed to rip off inexperienced traders.

To the people saying I am wrong or I am paying fees, please look at this transaction where I paid zero fees.

The added benefit is self-custody, less worry that your exchange will just run away with all your funds or (pretend to) get hacked... if you trade large amounts you can't afford to lose, prefer a hardware wallet supported by the DEX you've chosen.",4,0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jflc4d

Comment,1jflc4d,RedditExecutiveAdmin,1742485293.0,"here ya go, simple gen AI answer:

Yes, there's a significant difference between spreads and fees when trading assets:
Spreads:

A spread is the difference between the buy (ask) and sell (bid) price of an asset
The trading platform/broker profits from this price gap without charging an explicit fee
Spreads are typically measured in ""pips"" or percentage points
You pay the spread implicitly whenever you enter and exit a position
Spreads are most common in forex, CFDs, and other OTC markets

Fees:

Fees are explicit charges applied to your trades
They're usually a fixed amount or a percentage of the transaction value
Common types include commission fees, transaction fees, and account maintenance fees
Fees are more common in stock trading, futures, and exchanges with central order books
They appear as separate line items on your trading statement

Key differences:

Transparency: Fees are explicitly stated while spreads are built into the price
Cost structure: Spreads vary with market conditions while fees are often fixed
Market type: Spreads are more common in dealer markets, fees in exchange markets

Some platforms use a combination of both pricing models, and pricing structures can vary significantly between brokers and asset classes.",-2,0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jflc4d

Comment,1jflc4d,Nrgte,1742543411.0,"I linked another reddit thread. Convert has different underlying prices than the regular market and the difference is your fees. Quote from that thread:

> Check rates carefully. For instance, at this particular moment, 1 BNB in spot is 333.3 BUSD, in convert - 334.2 BUSD. But conversion fees are 0, yes.

For Limit orders that usually means they get executed delayed. So let's say you want to sell a coin for $25. But when the spot price is already at $25 the underlying price for convert may only be at $24.8 or something. And effectively only gets filled once the spot price is at $25.2. Those .2 in this example would be your fees.

And Binance admits that in the site you've linked. I quote again:

Comment,1jflc4d,SquatDeadliftBench,1742545573.0,"I don’t disagree with what you’re saying at all and you’re essentially reiterating what I mentioned in other replies: Binance uses my money to make money (through their fees) by applying whatever exchange rate benefits them.

However, in my experience, when I set a price, for example, selling 1 BTC for $100,000, I received exactly $100,000.

(I don’t actually own 1 BTC; this is just an example.)

Now, did Binance sell it for, say, $101,000, keep the difference, and make it appear as if the trade was executed at $100,000 within their app and conversion system? Most likely. But ultimately, whatever mechanism they use resulted in zero fees for me because they honored the price I set in the trade.

Why does this matter? Because whatever Binance is doing still results in a far better deal than what other exchanges offer. Many of them exploit ridiculous spreads, where you’re not just paying fees, you’re also losing money on bad fills. They take a cut from both the buyer and the seller, and if you’re trading in high volume, those “tiny” fees add up fast. Meanwhile, with a simple spot limit order convert on Binance, I get exactly what I ask for, with no hidden fees for me specifically. That is all I am talking about.

No because you could use a regular limit order at $101'000 and make more money if that's what you want to do. This basically means that you take additional risk (for the price difference) without getting the reward. And that's essentially a price you pay.

And there are instances when the spot price reaches your limit order, but the convert price doesn't, in which case your trade doesn't get executed. Ask yourself if you'd be okay if you placed a limit order at 100'000 and Binance internally changes it to 101'000 without telling you?

Additionally it's hard to know exactly how big the difference in price is, so the lack of transparency is an issue for me.

The page says “may”, but in my experience-after thousands of Convert trades-I have always received exactly the price I input. I even provided proof, yet you keep insisting I’m being ""robbed"" without any evidence. How?

First, you assumed it was a promotion. It wasn’t.

Then, you assumed it was the website OP was angry at. It wasn’t.

Next, because you didn't recognize the exchange, it tells me you’ve never used it. So why confidently speak on something you’ve never tried?

Finally, when faced with actual proof that I provided to help people like OP avoid insane spreads at the very start, you dismissed and ignored it and instead relied on hypothetical and irrelevant situations, such as selling my BTC at a higher price using regular limit trade and PAYING a fee. I mean if my desired exit price was 100,000$ and I got 100,000$ and not a penny came out of my 100,000$, how is that not mind-blowingly amazing to you?

Okay I'm taking one last attempt to explain this to you. Because your order doesn't get triggered at $100'000 but rather at a higher value (I'm using 101'000 as an example again). In most instances if the price reaches 100k it likely also reaches 101k so you wouldn't notice anything. That's why it's no big deal to you.

But there is a rare occasion where the price might reach 100,500 and your limit order doesn't trigger. So by having essentially a different limit price than the one you enter, you take additional risk, while Binance reaps the reward.

Usually the spread is larger than the fee on the regular market, so you'd be better off just paying the regular fee and setting the limit order to 101k yourself. There are lot of guides on youtube that explain spread if my example is confusing (english isn't my native language).

This is really well known, so don't spread misinformation that there are no fees. Spread are fees that you pay even if it may not be visible to you because the exchange tries to hide how much they take from you.

You've seen my screenshot where Binance says that the value you enter may not be the final value. The final value is always to your disadvantage, that's the fee and how Binance makes money on your back.

Comment,1jflc4d,SquatDeadliftBench,1742621745.0,"This response is still flawed and relies on a hypothetical risk scenario.

I appreciate the attempt, but you’re still misunderstanding how this works.

1. You're assuming my order triggers at $101,000 instead of $100,000—but where’s the proof?

You keep repeating this claim, but my actual trades contradict it. Binance fills my orders at the exact price I set, and I have provided proof of this.

You, on the other hand, have never used it and are relying on hypotheticals.



2. Your ""rare occasion"" argument is irrelevant.

Yes, if the market only reaches $100,500, a regular limit order at $101,000 wouldn’t fill.

But my limit order at $100,000 would still execute. So where’s the issue?

If anything, your argument proves why this method is safer, since it guarantees a fill at the desired price rather than hoping for a slightly higher price that may never come.



3. Spread isn’t a fee if I get what I want.

Fees are explicit charges deducted from my trade—not theoretical losses based on what could have happened in a different scenario.

If I place a limit order at $100,000 and get exactly $100,000, no fees are being taken from me.

Whether Binance profits behind the scenes is irrelevant to me, because my trade executes exactly as I intended with zero deductions.



4. You’ve shifted from “you’re being charged” to “Binance hides how it profits.”

These are two separate claims. If Binance profits from spreads, arbitrage, or other internal mechanisms, that’s not the same as me paying a fee.

The key point is that I always receive the full amount I input, which is not the case with standard fee-based trading.




At the end of the day, I’m not spreading misinformation—I’m just stating my actual trading results, backed by evidence. Meanwhile, you’re arguing based on assumptions, hypotheticals, and YouTube videos instead of actual experience.

If you don’t want to use Spot Limit Convert, that’s your choice. But don’t tell people they’re ""paying hidden fees"" when they’re getting exactly what they asked for—without deductions.

Comment,1jfrek7,coinfeeds-bot,1742484606.0,"tldr; Crypto.com is facing backlash after reversing a 2021 decision to burn 70 billion Cronos (CRO) tokens, a move initially aimed at decentralizing its blockchain. The re-issuance, approved through a controversial vote, has sparked accusations of vote manipulation, as Crypto.com allegedly controls 70-80% of voting power. Critics argue the decision undermines community trust and decentralization. CEO Kris Marszalek has not directly addressed the issue but announced an AMA event to discuss concerns on March 25.

Comment,1jf27vl,TheOldYoungster,1742465911.0,"The difference is that in real markets there is something behind it. Of course everthing's beneficial ""if you got in early enough"". That's not what makes it a ponzi.

Housing means that in exchange for your money you get a house where you can live, which you can rent or later resell at a higher price if the location improves, etc. Same for stocks and funds, that money is used to create value and you get dividends from the profits that occur at the end of a productive cycle that involves goods and services.

However, ponzis are defined by the lack of a productive process. You put the money into *nothing*. Your ""profits"" are just the input from other fools that joined after you did, and sooner or later there will be no more fools to keep the wheel spinning. No real profit can be created because there is no productive activity at all.

What does CRO do? Nothing. It's just a crypto-endogamic defi circlejerk with no real world application. No companies are using CRO as a payment channel. No traceability in supply chains or authentications of documents/assets are being carried out using CRO. Nobody uses CRO for anything that can't be done better and cheaper with some other tool.

Comment,1jfxtrn,Numerous_Wonders81,1742501563.0,"1. Energy Intensity – The Fundamental Flaw of PoW
PoW mining, as acknowledged by the SEC, requires massive computational resources to validate transactions and secure the network. This reliance on brute-force computing power results in:

A. Unsustainable Energy Consumption
Bitcoin alone consumes more electricity than some countries (e.g., Argentina, the Netherlands).
Miners are incentivized to relocate to areas with the cheapest electricity, often leading to exploitation of coal-based or other unsustainable energy sources.
Even with ""green mining"" initiatives, the overall carbon footprint remains disproportionately high.

B. Centralization of Mining in Energy-Rich Regions
Despite Bitcoin’s goal of decentralization, mining is heavily centralized in regions with cheap electricity (e.g., Texas, Russia, Kazakhstan).
This leads to geopolitical risks—if a country bans mining, it can suddenly disrupt network security and the economy of Bitcoin miners.

2. Hardware Waste and E-Waste Crisis
PoW mining isn’t just bad for electricity grids—it also contributes heavily to electronic waste (e-waste).

Specialized ASIC miners (used for Bitcoin) become obsolete within 2-3 years and are difficult to repurpose.
A single Bitcoin transaction consumes hardware equivalent to the lifespan of two iPhones worth of e-waste.

Unlike general-purpose computers, ASICs can’t be reused once they become unprofitable, leading to landfills full of outdated mining rigs.

3. PoW is Financially and Structurally Unsustainable
PoW relies on a continuous arms race—miners must constantly upgrade their hardware to remain competitive. This has several consequences:

A. Mining Becomes an Oligopoly
Only wealthy mining farms with access to cheap electricity and top-tier hardware can compete.
Regular individuals are priced out, making Bitcoin’s security reliant on a few powerful mining pools.

B. Declining Block Rewards Will Lead to Unsustainable Fees
Bitcoin’s block rewards halve every four years (the ""Halving"").
As rewards decrease, miners will demand higher transaction fees to remain profitable.
This will make Bitcoin transactions slow and expensive, harming its usability as a currency.

4. PoW Networks Are Not Environmentally Justifiable
Even if miners use renewable energy, PoW still wastes resources that could be used for other industries:

Data centers and AI research could use the same energy for something more productive.
Climate goals are undermined as governments struggle to justify sustainable energy subsidies going to Bitcoin miners instead of essential infrastructure.

5. PoW’s Security Model is Flawed in the Long Run
While PoW is currently secure, it faces serious long-term vulnerabilities:

A. 51% Attacks Are More Feasible Than People Think
If a mining pool or nation-state gains 51% of the hashrate, they can double-spend and disrupt the network.

Unlike Proof-of-Stake (PoS), where attackers have financial incentives to protect the system, PoW miners can be bribed or coerced.

B. Quantum Computing Threats

PoW is not future-proof against quantum attacks.
A powerful quantum computer could reverse Bitcoin’s cryptographic security, invalidating PoW mining altogether.

PoW is an Outdated and Flawed System
The SEC statement clarifies that PoW mining itself isn’t necessarily subject to securities laws—but that doesn’t mean it’s economically, environmentally, or structurally viable in the long term. Energy consumption, e-waste, mining centralization, and long-term security risks all make PoW inferior to more modern consensus mechanisms like Proof-of-Stake (PoS).

The industry must move on from PoW to ensure crypto’s sustainability, decentralization, and future adoption—which is why Algorand and other PoS chains are already solving these problems without the massive waste and inefficiencies of PoW.",0,0,https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-certain-proof-work-mining-activities-032025

In PoS, validators are punished financially for dishonest behavior, which is the opposite of fiat, where central banks print at will and face zero consequence.

In fact, many PoS systems like Algorand or Hedera have fixed or transparent monetary policies, strong governance models, and economic finality without burning gigawatts of electricity. There's no central authority arbitrarily deciding rates or bailouts—there’s protocol-level consensus with real-time accountability.

Bitcoiners criticize central banks for being opaque, slow, and manipulative—but then turn around and reject systems designed to solve those exact problems. PoS isn't fiat. It's evolution.",1,0,https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-certain-proof-work-mining-activities-032025

Comment,1jfdw8s,coinfeeds-bot,1742436603.0,"tldr; Bitcoin (BTC) surged to an intraday high of $85,950 after the Federal Reserve announced it would maintain interest rates in the 4.25%-4.5% range and projected two rate cuts in 2025. The Fed also confirmed a reduction in its quantitative tightening policy. These developments aligned with market expectations, boosting both Bitcoin and equities, with the DOW gaining 400 points and the S&P 500 rising by 77 points. Traders view the Fed's stance as supportive of Bitcoin's ongoing recovery.

Comment,1jfdw8s,critiqueextension,1742443567.0,"While the post mentions a projected Bitcoin price of $86K following the Fed's rate cuts, it is essential to note that analysts predict a more conservative price increase, with some expecting Bitcoin could rise significantly, potentially reaching $250,000 by the end of the year due to liquidity from the Fed's monetary policy. This perspective suggests that while the market may react positively, projected price thresholds could be more ambitious based on broader economic factors.

Comment,1jfzbw6,MaximumStudent1839,1742535692.0,"As usual, the extraction game continues. Told you all how the KOLs and VCs will dump on your asses. You all didn’t listen and went to donate your pay checks. 

All these mfers printed this coin out of thin air and listed instantly above $2B FDV with hardly any price discovery.

wtf do you think these “blue chip” project will do? They have been issuing assets like drunken sailor. First it was the big penguins. Then it was the small penguins. Then they issued rods. Now they issued this token. Next they will issue another token for their abstract chain. 

They won’t take care of you plebs. Their priority is to appease the whales. The whales are KOLs, VCs, shitcoin callers, etc. They want their endless slice of your blood and sweat until they actually grow super obese like their pfps.

Pudgies got plenty of airdrops from other projects and all their charts get massacre in a few weeks.

Comment,1jexb4i,coinfeeds-bot,1742392211.0,"tldr; Bitcoin and the crypto market are bracing for potential Federal Reserve actions that could impact prices. Arthur Hayes, cofounder of BitMex, predicts the Fed may inject liquidity into markets, potentially triggering a bitcoin price surge. Speculation surrounds the Fed's stance on quantitative tightening and interest rates, with $9 trillion in debt maturity this year. Hayes forecasts a bitcoin price of $250,000 by year-end, citing parallels to the post-Covid stimulus-driven price boom. The Fed's upcoming decisions are seen as pivotal for market direction.

Comment,1jgeg1h,biba8163,1742566095.0,"Jed McCaleb is the GOAT of Crypto Scammers:

- Scammer who sold Mt. Gox to Karpeles after being ""hacked"" and short tens of thousands of Bitcoin

- Scammer who then founded Ripple and kept 9 Billion XRP to himself

- Scammer then founded Stellar and kept an unknown supply of XLM himself

- Scammer who after dumping BILLIONS, is launching his own space station:

    https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/21/jed-mccalebs-vast-acquires-launcher.html


When McCaleb sold the site to Karpeles, Mt.Gox had been hacked multiple times already and there were 80,000 BTC missing from the exchange.  McCaleb told Karpeles not to worry too much about it and slowly manipulate with bots to buy more BTC, mine it, etc to make up the difference.  All this is documented in Mt. Gox court papers where the emails were submitted as evidence. 

> From: Jed McCaleb

> Date: 2011/04/28 22:33

> To: Mark Karpeles

> I can’t tell how big an issue it will be to be short 80k BTC if the price goes to $100 or something. That is quite a bit to owe at that point but mtgox should have made a ton of BTC getting to there. There is also still the fact that the BTC balance will probably never fall below 80k. So maybe you don’t really need to worry about it


> There are 3 solutions I have thought of:

> - Slowly buy more BTC with the USD that Gox Bot has. Hopefully you would fill up the loss before the price got out of hand.

> - Buy a big chunk of BTC (really just moving the BTC debt to the USD side)[.] If BTC goes up this is a huge win. Problem is there isn’t enough BTC for sale on mtgox. Maybe you could find someone on the forum to do it?

> - Get those crystal island people to invest. They have 200+ BTC so they could fill in the gap.

> Maybe you could just mine it?

Comment,1jf2rlj,coinfeeds-bot,1742406610.0,"tldr; Michael Saylor, co-founder of Strategy, proposed at the White House Crypto Summit that the U.S. government acquire 5-25% of Bitcoin's total supply over 20 years, sparking debate over its legality and market impact. Critics, including pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton, argue this would primarily benefit Saylor, whose firm holds significant Bitcoin reserves. Saylor also suggested a new digital asset classification to clarify regulatory oversight. Strategy plans to issue 5M shares to fund more Bitcoin purchases, raising concerns about financial risks and potential government intervention.

Comment,1jf2rlj,HesitantInvestor0,1742420025.0,"Air is for everyone too. But if some company started sucking it all up and hoarding it I’d be concerned.

Not equating Bitcoin to air, just an example that things can be abused. Hoarding scarce things isn’t typically viewed as being a net benefit to the world. Saylor is just going to be a risk to Bitcoin as he tries to be the largest holder. It allows more manipulation, leverage, derivatives, arbitrage, etc. That’s stuff that was criticized of the traditional system. I got involved with Bitcoin because the traditional system felt fragile. Well, now Bitcoin is a part of it. I don’t think Bitcoin has grown stronger in the past few years, it’s being bastardized.

As I said before, Bitcoin is there for anyone, including North Korean scammers, idiots like Saylor, Blackrock, et al. I’m allowed to be critical of it, or to be disappointed that things are where they are.",2,0,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/saylor-asks-us-to-buy-5-to-25-bitcoin-supply/

If it wasn't Saylor it would be some other rich scmuck and quite honestly I am glad it is Saylor who understands the history of economics a lot better than your average CEO it seems. The name calling on here just makes it seem like jealousy that they didn't come up with the leveraged bond scheme first or they don't have as much as he does.

Comment,1jgd1h9,thistimelineisweird,1742562363.0,"A lot of people can become crypto millionaires, but you need to adjust your scope for reasonable gains (less than 10x) instead of 100x, 1000x, or more. 

Yes, that means starting with more money, but I suspect more people are going to be able to take $100k to $1MM than those who will take $10, $100, $1,000, etc. to $1MM. Hell, more people will probably go from $2MM to $1MM than those who get lucky on a single token popping.

The long game pays off. The short game doesn't. End of story.

Right now, I'm beating the stock market returns by about double (25% or so annual rate of return, sometimes swings as high as 40% in the right moment).

Previously, employees were required to hold assets for at least 90 days before selling. Binance claims to have measures in place to prevent insider trading, including internal audits and rewards for tips leading to evidence of such activities. The company facilitated over $17 billion in spot trades on the same day this policy change was reported.

Santori and others noted that crypto voters played a pivotal role in election outcomes, with lobbying efforts credited for the GOP's success in securing Congress and the presidency.

Comment,1jexp0n,coinfeeds-bot,1742393410.0,"tldr; Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced that the SEC has dropped its appeal in the landmark case against Ripple, marking a significant development in crypto regulation. The SEC had sued Ripple in 2020, alleging it illegally sold XRP as an unregistered security. A 2023 ruling found XRP was a security only when sold to institutional investors, leading to a reduced penalty for Ripple. This case was pivotal in shaping the crypto industry's legal landscape, inspiring other companies to challenge the SEC.

Their idea of a “bridge currency” is obsolete now with the introduction of defi and using stable coins/RWAs for DvP atomic swaps.

Comment,1jf55gm,SaulMalone_Geologist,1742449161.0,"You spend Ethereum to 'power' smart contracts that let you do things like take USD loans against tokenized staked ETH, where you're earning interest on your collateral at the same time that you're borrowing against it's value. 

Those USD loans may come in the form of USDC, tokenized by smart contracts on Ethereum, and you might send them to Coinbase over Eth or Arbitrum to turn into cash deposited in your bank account. You'll pay a bit of ETH for that smart contract engagement too. 

If you sent over Arbitrum, you paid a small amount of ETH, and eventually the Arbitrum systems will pay in ETH to write a kind of batched set of transactions to the main ethereum network, securing all the Arbitrum transactions with the parent network's security guarantees.

You can do that on other chains too, but none of them are anywhere near as big of a pool as the Ethereum-based pools are dealing with on the regular.

Comment,1jf55gm,Double-Risky,1742438627.0,"I mean I guess the best analogy I can give, is that AOL had early adoption for stage 2 of the Internet, with stage 1 being tech heavy enthusiasts and stage 2 being average people starting to join in. 

We are still in stage 1 with crypto,despite the hype. Average people aren't actually utilizing it, they are gambling in Robinhood and coinbase. 

And AOL managed to dominate stage 2, while failing to keep up with stage 3, actual mass adoption.  They still exist, and got merged here and there, but they aren't the Internet leader. And they had a near monopoly on it early days.  And it's because they couldn't keep up with changes around them.

We will see. But I am having a harder and harder time thinking eth will be the backbone of a real decentralized future, without the major overhauls they've been talking about for years. 

Why should a second layer use eth for settlement, if other options are better or they can do it themselves? 

Who knows we'll see.

Edit
Some of those are huge, some are kinda speculative still, dipping toes or pilot programs, etc many are just still geared towards people already in crypto 

But this one sounds very interesting and could be done well

Lots of wannabe “ETH Killers” are shilling that idea to sell you their token. It’s a common tech trope - Every grifter selling a newer new.

Meanwhile, Solana is a bloated mess at 300TB growing 1-2TB each week - making it impossible to decentralize and contributing to frequent outages. 

Ethereum is 1TB total.

Ethereum has always pursued a lean, lightweight L1 model that scales with L2s because it’s the best approach. There’s no reason to store every latte purchase or memecoin trade on Layer 1 for millennia.

He argues that retail investors are entering the market through Bitcoin ETFs rather than on-chain transactions, which skews traditional metrics. Since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, inflows have reached $35.88 billion, with 80% attributed to retail investors. Ju predicts a bear market and a potential 6-12 month delay for Bitcoin to reach new all-time highs.

It'll be hugely profitable for investors as they'll be able to ride out boom-bust recessions in an alternate market, which in turn will act as a dampener on the severity of those recession periods. Especially for those few big fish who got in first.. which is why it will for sure happen. The groups who coordinate to manipulate markets can get very much even richer, if they coordinate to manipulate our market just as a recession begins biting.

Hmm  

>BlackRock: **Recession** Could Ignite Bitcoin

And yeah, of course Bitcoin drops more, it's always been a volatile asset. Bitcoin may have dropped more during the panic, but it recovered far quicker (BTC reached 2020 Feb highs again in early May while it took the SP500 till August to recover to its 2020 Feb high). And we all know how BTC exploded later that year.

But the last time the US was in a proper recession Bitcoin had just been created. No one can really say anything other than speculate about how Bitcoin will perform during a recession.

Comment,1jeuhmz,South-Attorney-5209,1742398911.0,"???? Higher interest rates are a result of monetary policy. One use of setting high rates is to combat inflation, which we experienced due to a global supply shock massively altering the supply/demand curve.

Inflation has not met target yet so rates will remain high. Unfortunately due to major changes in fiscal policy the last month from the new admin, many are predicting a total drop in economic activity and GDP.

If economic activity drops in presence of inflation you are in stagflation. Again high interest rates drive economic activity lower. A long period of stagflation or moronic fiscal policy can push it to deflation.

The person with 10000 bitcoin didnt have to be rich. He could have mined them in the past. He could have used $ 10.000 of his savings and bought 10.000 bitcoin for 1$ dollar each. He got rich because of this decision. ""the rich"" didnt become richer. ""the rich"" dont all have 1000s of bitcoins. There are a lot rich that dont have bitcoin so they can get poor in a situation where the dollar becomes worthless. And the person who ""only"" has 10 bitcoin might get richer then them.

What’s interesting about that is the big boys that can move the market can re enter when ever they want and create immediate large price movement, that means that in the case of a proper recovery the market will do that in a very short time frame.",3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jfbrte/daily_crypto_discussion_march_20_2025_gmt0/

Comment,1jfbrte,Due-Inspection-5660,1742496759.0,"tariff update: The EU has delayed its retaliatory tariffs on the US to give more time for them to negotiate and agree a deal to avoid tariffs on both sides

[https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/20/eu-delays-first-retaliatory-tariffs-on-us-goods-to-mid-april.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/20/eu-delays-first-retaliatory-tariffs-on-us-goods-to-mid-april.html)

  
The phase one delay was put in motion to allow “additional time for discussions with the US administration,” European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill said in a statement to CNN. “The change represents a slight adjustment to the timeline and does not diminish the impact of our response.”

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday the delay reflects the extent to which “countries are taking the president seriously.”

“They understand that he is going to do what’s right for American workers and families,” she said, adding that “the president and his team are in constant communication with our EU counterparts.”

“This is a very positive development and gives US distillers a glimmer of hope that a devastating 50% tariff on American whiskey can be averted,” US Distilled Spirits Council president and CEO Chris Swonger said in a statement Thursday.

In my opinion it's now very likely that the EU and canada will agree deals with the US to avoid/minimize tariffs in the coming weeks. This will give bitcoin an immediate boost back above 95k and we'll have plenty of further boosts when the fed slashes interest rates.",4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jfbrte/daily_crypto_discussion_march_20_2025_gmt0/

Comment,1jfbrte,jpoptarts,1742488176.0,"shouldn't pi network's circulating supply be based on its unlocked coins instead of total migrated coins?


tl;dr: I think that the current marketcap is a bit overvalued and misleading

if you take a look at their explorer on their official website, we can see that of the ~7B circulating supply only ~1.7B is unlocked, and can therefore be moved around

imo the unlocked number should count instead of total migrated pi when it comes to ranking it on CoinMarketCap 

this would decrease its ranking from #17 to around the 40s-50s place, which is still big but leaves more room for growth (a.k.a. higher prices for Pi holders to sell at lol)",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jfbrte/daily_crypto_discussion_march_20_2025_gmt0/

If there isnt a market wide surge to close this month then we unfortunately will be crabbing and bleeding until the second half of the year.

If we get a surge to close the month, then we continue the next leg up.

What catalysts could contribute to a surge? FTX, PI(token unlock) have contributed direct liquidity boosts to the market. Global M2 supply aswell as gold keep hitting new ATHs recently, they normally lead BTC by a multitude of weeks and so if that trend is too continue then BTC will start pumping now. And finally we have Trump, for all the doom and gloom he has caused, he has fully blown his load, he could roll back on Tariffs, actually secure a ceasefire in Ukraine, announce no capital gains tax (rumour I keep seeing) on American Crypto Currencies. Finally we also have China considering a SBR.

As of this moment, liquidity is still here but it is itching to fuck off, we need a strong rally to end the month.",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jfbrte/daily_crypto_discussion_march_20_2025_gmt0/

Comment,1jfbrte,punishGoalhanging,1742508704.0,"made this post a little early but it is not showing up.  I will copy and paste it here also for discussion.

**$36 billion: my educated guess of the amount of none-purchased crypto that miners, exchanges, hackers, coin founders (unlock coins), governments have sold in the past 12 months **

submitted 2 minutes ago by punishGoalhanging

I had an argue with a friend recently about the amount of none-purchased crypto that have been sold in the past 12 months. Did some research by quick googling.

Exchanges selling: I am guessing maybe around $15 billion a year

Miners selling: I am guessing maybe around $10 billion a year

Founder selling unlocked coins: I am guessing maybe $8 billion a year

Hackers selling: I am guessing maybe $2 billion a year

Government selling confiscated coins: I am guessing maybe $1 billion a year

Some sources to back up my guess:

Exchanges selling: 

Quick google search....coinbase annual revenue is $6.6 billion.

Binance 2022 annual revenue is $12 billion.

etc....

A lot of the exchange revenues are from selling none-purchased crypto.  



Founders selling unlocked coins  (founders selling some of these none-purchased coins)

$3.46 billion in crypto tokens to be unlocked in October 2024

November 2024 will see $2.6 billion worth of crypto tokens unlocked across major blockchain projects, including Sui, Aptos, Arbitrum, and more. These releases will affect market liquidity and token values.

December 2024 will see $5.08 billion worth of tokens unlocked, with $1.99 billion classified as cliff unlocks. Major projects include Jito, Cardano, Aptos, Sui, Arbitrum, and Optimism. Token unlocks could increase market volatility and present buying opportunities.

Jan 15, 2025 — According to CryptoRank, a research and analytics platform focused on crypto data, January will see around $7.2 billion in crypto token unlocks.

In February 2025, the market is set for over $3.13B in token unlocks from major projects like XRP, SUI, JTO, GAL, TAI, and NTRN which could change liquidity levels and influence price trends.

Even cryptodotcom recently vote to ""unlock"" 70billion CRO over a span of 5 years (about $5 billion USD).

Fiat-to-Crypto Transactions:

When you buy or deposit crypto using fiat (like USD or EUR), exchanges often charge fees in fiat, such as a percentage of the transaction amount or a flat fee. 

Crypto-to-Crypto Transactions:

When you trade one cryptocurrency for another, fees are usually charged in the cryptocurrency itself, often as a percentage of the traded amount. 

Withdrawal Fees:

Exchanges also charge fees for withdrawing both fiat and crypto. Fiat withdrawals may incur fees in fiat, while crypto withdrawals are often settled in the cryptocurrency you're withdrawing, covering blockchain transaction costs.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jfbrte/daily_crypto_discussion_march_20_2025_gmt0/

Comment,1jfbrte,Defusion55,1742509638.0,"I don't get this ""thank obama for that"" when it comes to healthcare. It only helped dozens of people I know and those that felt otherwise fail to provide examples. Obama made it so kids could stay on their parents insurance until 26 which basically allowed all of my friends to go from HS to college full time and not have to worry about healthcare. Then of those friends that graduated and got low paying entry level jobs \~30k/year obamacare allowed them to get healthcare plans for $50-150 month. it worked so well that Trump actually kept it and I heard made improvements? I moved and had to get a new job that was a big pay cut from what I was earning before and so I applied for it under Trumps first presidency and I was able to get on a plan for $58/month but not exactly thanks to Trump since it was Obamas program he started.

When I see people mention it being expensive and tripling etc I have to assume its because these people have decent jobs. For example of my friends circle about 6 of us had low income jobs in rural towns and used it. 2 of these friends landed IT related remote jobs making a jump of income from \~40k/year to $80k/year but lo and behold their $100/month healthcare under the affordable health care act jumped to $400/month so while it quadrupled going from $1200/year to $4800 year sounds like a lot when you factor in their new salary who the fuck cares? Would you rather pay $1200 in healthcare earning 40k or pay $4800 in healthcare and earn $80k? This is what has always been consistent in my circles. people earn shit get cheap haelthcare then the moment they finally start to earn a ""decent"" wage lose their ever loving shit when their healthcare goes up when at the end of the year they still have more money in their bank than they did with the cheaper shit. it makes no sense.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jfbrte/daily_crypto_discussion_march_20_2025_gmt0/

Except for the buttery males

>trump put a stop to that and made gas prices lower

Gas prices increased at the start of Obama's term, a result of taking office mid recession while prices were suppressed because of said recession. Oil production increased throughout Obama's term, resulting in lower gas prices towards the end of his time in office.

Obama never moved forward with his cap and trade plane that you are referring to with that ""skyrocket"" quote

That's fine, only price that matters if the price where OP was trading.

> So what will your source of truth be?

the price where OP was trading.

> An average of the top 10 exchanges?

no

>But that average was never actually available to buy or sell at that price. And price is dictated by volume. You might be able to sell 1 sat at $87,000/BTC but if you try to sell 10,000 BTC you will not get that average price. It will be lower due to open orders available for filling at that point in time.

* Monitor for unusual system behavior, including unexpected system reboots, suspicious outbound network connections, or unexplained changes to Windows registry values
* Check for the presence of unfamiliar processes or services, particularly those with names similar to ""WWStartupCtrl64.dll""
* Look for unexpected cryptocurrency wallet extensions in your Chrome browser, as StilachiRAT targets 20 different wallet extensions
* Be alert for any signs of credential theft, such as unexpected logins to your accounts or changes to saved passwords in Chrome
* Use network monitoring tools to check for suspicious connections, especially on TCP ports 53, 443, or 16000, which StilachiRAT uses for communication
* Examine your system and security logs for any signs of tampering or clearing, as StilachiRAT has the ability to clear event logs",65,0,https://i.redd.it/2352nx48zipe1.jpeg

__How to stay safe from StilachiRAT__

In order to avoid infection from this RAT, Microsoft’s advice is pretty simple: Make sure to only download software from official websites and use security software that can block malicious domains and email attachments.

That means you should install the best antivirus software on your PC and make sure you’re keeping it up to date. You also want to know the common signs of phishing attacks such as misspelled domain names or email signatures, attachments from unknown senders, or messages that contain a sense of urgency or even threats of a legal nature that encourage you to click or download something.

Never click on something that you aren’t expecting or don’t know what it is or who sent it and when in doubt, contact the sender in a separate message or email. If a domain name or URL seems suspicious then go to it directly by typing it into the browser window instead of by clicking on a link. You can also use a VPN to protect your privacy further and a password manager to keep your passwords safe.

New malware strains like this one are created everyday but by practicing good cyber hygiene and staying up to date on the latest attack methods, you can avoid falling victim to StilachiRAT and other online threats.

Comment,1jehzzw,EnjoyerOfBeans,1742352685.0,"This malware specifically only targets Google Chrome system directories on Windows. If you're using any chromium based browser that is not Chrome, or you're not using Windows, you will not be affected by this one in particular (assuming there are no versions of this malware floating around targeting other browsers in the same way). It also isn't a chromium exploit, this can be replicated easily in Firefox as well because it doesn't use any browser vulnerabilities, just decrypts persistent data like your system does when you launch the browser.

The ""vulnerability"" it's exploiting is the fact that people allow their browsers to keep sensitive data that is decrypted any time a browser is open (or even not, by using the Windows API). We've known for years that you should never under any circumstance let your browser save any credentials. They might as well be stored in plain text and there's no way to make it more secure.

Comment,1jehzzw,HaltheDestroyer,1742390266.0,"I developed an algorithm that uses a specific combination of numbers letters special symbols and different cases to generate passwords that are unique for every website I use 

Kind of funny but I developed this process when I was in the U.S. Army and we had to generate super secure passwords for all of our logins that would expire very frequently 

I would explain the process further but so far it has worked out great for me and nothing has been compromise so far

The best part is if one password is compromised the others are safe because every site has an alphanumeric key that I generate as part of the password for every unique site.....and it's all done mentally and never saved to a browser because it's easy to remember mentally as long as you follow the rules of the password

The password length is about 19-25 characters once completed and simple to remember....even my wife has swapped to using this password generation method because she finally admitted it was smart

This will do nothing to help against sites being compromised and data being stolen but at least if they get 1 of my passwords they still don't have the keys to the kingdom and the passwords themselves would take trillions of years to bruteforce",13,0,https://i.redd.it/2352nx48zipe1.jpeg

Then you add the website on to the end of it (reddit.com), and perhaps an additional bit of information if you wanted to (perhaps a hint as to the username, an '@' symbol if it's an email, plenty of other options). So a password you end up with is ""4X3pr\*!reddit.com@gm"". According to a password strength tester it has 131 bits of entropy and will take sextillions of years to be cracked.

But basically your method is the one rule you have to follow for every site.... and you insert your basic code after it

And now you can double the length of this password by slacking it (Type your basic code once normally and a 2nd time while holding shift on your keyboard)

Comment,1jehzzw,bierli,1742403339.0,"ChatGPT

When using a **Ledger hardware wallet**, you need a specific **crypto wallet application** (like Ledger Live or third-party wallets such as MetaMask or Electrum) because of how **hardware wallets** interact with blockchains and manage private keys securely. Here’s why:

### **1. Hardware Wallets Store Private Keys Securely**
Ledger devices **store your private keys** offline, keeping them safe from malware and hackers. However, they do **not** connect directly to blockchains or generate transactions themselves.

### **2. A Crypto Wallet Provides the Interface**
A crypto wallet (like **Ledger Live**) serves as the **bridge** between your Ledger hardware wallet and the blockchain. It allows you to:
- View balances and transactions.
- Generate and sign transactions.
- Interact with decentralized applications (DApps).
- Manage multiple cryptocurrencies.

### **3. Transactions Need to Be Signed Externally**
When you initiate a transaction using a wallet application:
1. The transaction is created on the app (e.g., Ledger Live, MetaMask).
2. The app **sends the transaction data** to your Ledger device for **offline signing**.
3. You **physically approve the transaction** on the Ledger device (ensuring security).
4. The signed transaction is then sent **back to the wallet** for broadcasting to the blockchain.

### **4. Compatibility with Different Blockchains**
Different blockchains use different standards (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana). Ledger hardware wallets require **specific wallet software** to correctly **interpret, manage, and broadcast transactions** on different blockchains.

### **5. Not All Wallets Support All Features**
- **Ledger Live** supports major assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and ERC-20 tokens.
- For **other coins**, third-party wallets (like MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or Electrum) must be used with Ledger.
- Some wallets offer **DeFi, NFT, or staking support**, which Ledger Live might not.

### **Conclusion**
Your Ledger hardware wallet acts as a **secure key vault**, but you still need a **crypto wallet app** to interact with the blockchain. The app ensures usability, while Ledger ensures security.",1,0,https://i.redd.it/2352nx48zipe1.jpeg

Comment,1jexv7v,coinfeeds-bot,1742394624.0,"tldr; Bitcoin may recover to $90,000 amid easing inflation concerns following the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. Markus Thielen, CEO of 10x Research, suggests Bitcoin could see a counter-trend rally as prices are oversold and the Federal Reserve adopts a dovish stance. Investor confidence may rise due to Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments about holding rates steady amid uncertainty. However, persistent inflation or tight financial conditions could limit Bitcoin's upside potential.

Comment,1jflnxa,Cptn_BenjaminWillard,1742468003.0,"Traditionally, looking back over the past several years, you could say that BTC often floats around 60% of mcap, ETH around 15%, and the rest (including stablecoins) accounting for the rest.  Obviously, those aren't the exact current amounts (ETH is down a lot) but close enough.  And we can ignore stablecoins, which skews the other numbers.

If I had to put funds in, knowing that you already have a BTC position, I'd probably put 40% into BTC and 40% into ETH, and 20% into just a couple of the others.  I won't say which ones.

If you didn't already have a BTC position, I'd recommend 70% BTC, 20% ETH, and 10% into a few others.

Others on this sub would disagree.  Some people really have a hatred for ETH.  Others feel that it has a lot of potential.  It does represent the majority of actual use of DeFi.  I try to look at everything in an analytical and dispassionate lens.

Disclaimer, I don't have any ETH, but I think it's really oversold right now.  I've had it in the past, and it looks very attractive to me right now.  I think it offers more potential returns than BTC in the medium term, BUT it also represents more risk so I wouldn't go all-in.  However, I do hold some BTC and ETH ETF's.

My bigger concern right now is systemic risk.  I wouldn't feel comfortable putting more into the market right now, because I think things are going to get very bad in the next 12 months due to the geopolitical situation.  But if you have your house in order, ie. you've retired all debt and have a nest egg to get you through some bad times, then DCA is the way.",3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jflnxa/looking_to_diversify/

Collective Shift CEO Ben Simpson noted that the current correction is one of only three or four over 25% in this cycle, compared to 12 in the previous cycle. He attributes the delay in the bull run's peak to macroeconomic conditions and global liquidity challenges, which are impacting the crypto market.

Comment,1jetsjf,coinfeeds-bot,1742380210.0,"tldr; On March 18, BlackRock's IBIT Bitcoin ETF saw a significant $218.1 million inflow, contributing to a total of $209 million in spot Bitcoin ETF inflows for the day. This marked the third consecutive day of positive flows, despite a $9 million outflow from ARK and no activity in other ETFs. The inflows reflect a reversal in investor sentiment after earlier outflows, with institutional demand remaining strong. The trend follows a three-day inflow pattern, signaling a redeployment of capital into Bitcoin ETFs.

The only reason I use CDC is because I can dump random stablecoins onto the debit card and spend them in the real world. To some extent, I don't even care about the rewards. Or the cashback. It's the ease of use of crypto -> cash. Anything else that comes my way is a plus. I have yet to find anybody that does it as seamlessly.

I don't have much of a stake in their inside products but I don't need them. The kind of purchases I make are frivolous Steam games on sale and things of that magnitude.

If CDC is the next FTX i bet you 100$ all major exchanges will get a bankrun, more rules will be out for exchanges and crypto as a whole will get hard damaged in a already bear market... That would be really shit for everyone. So I dont understand and dont get it why they dont just announced a burn and let the prise rise then make a proposal to mint 10b and lock it over 5 years. The backslash would be much much softer.

Also binance would maybe buy them instead of risking a bankrun like ftx.

That need is naught if none compare.

A palace built on broken backs,
A kingdom held through cruelest tax.
A throne of gold, a gilded chain,
Yet still it thirsts, yet still it drains.

It turns the poor against the poor,
It locks compassion past the door.
It sells the sky, it scars the sea,
Then claims itself as destiny.

But what is left when all is sold?
A hollow throne, a king grown cold.
A dragon buried ‘neath its keep,
Alone, afraid, too rich to sleep.

For wealth is dust, and power fades,
And greed will dig its own dark grave.
Yet still it takes, yet still it feeds,
For nothing dies as slow as greed.",-8,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jec87g/cryptocom_just_scammed_their_users_again_and/

Maybe ask yourself why a CRO and CDC stan is the only person trying to defend CDC despite CDC having radio silence on why this change was needed. If you're truly not an employee think about what CDC is doing and what reasons they could have for doing it, and the radio silence for what's going on. Hint it's not that they ""need more liquidity"" that's not how crypto works. the CRO supply was almost 150x as high as the bitcoin supply and Bitcoin got an ETF. The circulating supply increase was only need to give CDC a way to print money.

On top of that ask yourself why CDC hasn't done an audit since Dec. 2022 and why they won't do an audit that shows their liabilities.

No they cannot mint another 200T token. To make changes to the contract they must first issue a gonvernance vote that every Cro owner can vote on. Yeah they control most of the votes through their CDC validators, but it is completely wrong to say that ""they own the contract"" or could mint another 200T. They don't own anything, just the majority of votes as all CDC cashback card stakes are on the CDC validators. You cannot ""own"" a blockchain contract that uses a governance system 😂

Futhermore no, burnt tokens are not wiped from existance. They still exist, but on a wallet that you promise to never touch again and no one else can access either. This is what CDC changed with their V5 proposal. They will lay hands on this wallet again and send 1b Cro to their vesting/reserve wallet each month.

Again this shows how little you know about crypto. You think a burnt token or coin doesn't exist anymore but that is just wrong. It still exists but no one can access it anymore.

Comment,1jec87g,BeamImpact,1742350821.0,"Bro please look up how burning works. And while you do that look up how blockchain contracts work and what minting means 😂

Burning always requires some form of wallet that you send the burned tokens to. And yes you either send it to a wallet no one can ever access again, or to one of your own ones but you promise to never touch the wallet again. The latter can be done by for example deleting all records to access the wallet again. In the case of CDC they just said ""Well we never touch the wallet with the 70b burnt Cro again"" but now that  V5 has passed CDC will do exactly that.

Like honestly how hold are you that you try to argue about something that you clearly have no clue about. It's like seeing someone arguing in a university math class that a solution is wrong while all he can do is counting to 5 with one of his hands.",0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jec87g/cryptocom_just_scammed_their_users_again_and/

Comment,1jer404,coinfeeds-bot,1742367606.0,"tldr; Director Carl Erik Rinsch has been arrested on fraud charges for allegedly misusing $11 million intended for a Netflix series, spending it on cryptocurrency, luxury items, and personal expenses. Despite Netflix investing $55 million in the project, Rinsch failed to deliver any episodes. He faces charges including wire fraud and money laundering, with a potential sentence of up to 90 years in prison. Prosecutors claim he used the funds for speculative trading, luxury purchases, and legal fees, instead of completing the show.

Otherwise, theres always learning about self custody.

Of course, with any exchange, first making sure they list and support the tokens you want to deposit.

Secondly, and most **importantly** - double check what networks the exchange you are sending to can receive.

Comment,1jeowc6,coinfeeds-bot,1742358611.0,"tldr; Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Investment Management, stated that most memecoins in the cryptocurrency market will likely become 'worthless.' She attributed this to the proliferation of meme cryptocurrencies driven by blockchain and AI, which lack substantial value. Wood advised caution to investors, emphasizing that regulators like the SEC are not overseeing these assets. While some memecoins may endure as digital collectibles, she remains optimistic about established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether, predicting significant future growth for them.

Comment,1jeowc6,blingblingmofo,1742363388.0,"Yeah I already know the ones that are most likely: 

A-Tier DOGE, SHIB - established leaders survived prior cycle

B-Tier BONK, PEPE - new leaders of current meme cycle. Most likely to outperform A-Tier if meme cycle hits full swing. Most of the C and D tier memes would not exist without BONK and WIF. BONK (and Floki?) is the only coin on the list with utility similar to SHIB but also has the performance of Solana. PEPE is dominating as far as new ETH memes go.

C-Tier includes WIF, Pengu, Fartcoin, Popcat, Brett, Floki - coins that could bounce and generally worth 200M+. Most are on exchanges and plenty of liquidity. Possible could out perform but could very likely become worthless.

D-Tier everything else, casino grade, generally worth under $100m, very little liquidity, most worth well under $10m. Almost all of these will go to 0 but might make a few people a lot of money. Could also include coins from chains outside of Solana and ETH.

F-Tier Trump coin - obvious grift and top 10 wallets control 92% of the supply. Could it pump? Sure, but be prepared to get fucked when it starts vesting",3,0,https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/famed-investor-cathie-wood-says-most-memecoins-will-end-up-worthless

Sadly, crypto has changed and is heading in the direction of traditional markets. The problem is, there are no interesting returns anymore. Even buying some random stock a few days ago would’ve given you a 10–15% return in just a few days. What did crypto do during that time? Pump and dump, again and again.

Look at bitcoin and zoom out, people think it goes up in a straight line because over time it’s gained crazy value but it’s not like that at all. It’s often stalled by down years and flat months and the massive gains happen quickly and suddenly. It often moves for 3-6 months and goes flat or down. If you can’t hang on for a few years or longer your odds you’ll miss these runs.

Comment,1je6y6d,InLuigiWeTrust,1742335703.0,"How long have you been in crypto? Cause I don’t see any difference in this cycle of growth and correction as all the others since the beginning of bitcoin. 

Obviously there’s different “circumstances” surrounding each growth and correction cycle but at this point you can almost set your watch to it. I called it at the bottom last correction, I called it a year ago what price it would hit before correcting this time and sure enough I was right on the money, and I’m almost certain I can already call what the bottom of this correction is gonna be. 

I don’t even pay attention to the news or the charts at this point. I just look at the growth/correction ratios of all the previous cycles and apply that trend to my future predictions. The long-term trend is ridiculously predictable at this point. If you’re not day trading it’s incredibly easy to time the crypto markets. 

And if that’s too hard for you, just watch the news articles. If majority of crypto related articles are positive, we’re in or about to be in a growth cycle. Vice versa when majority go negative, we’re in or about to be in a correction. The price is clearly dependent on investor confidence which is clearly correlated with the articles being published.

US stock market is overvalued. Look, there are some use cases for crypto but let’s be real. It’s not real. In the real world it has no practical use. It’s a speculative asset. Look at the richest people in America. Are they buying or selling crypto? Musk, Trump, celebs etc. follow the money. Crypto as a whole is just passing the bag onto the next guy hoping you’re not stuck with it. I’m sure I’ll get downvoted and get replies of “it does have uses you can stake your coin at blah blah blah”. 

It’s not fucking real man. We all just want to profit. Crypto will bottom out. I’m not sure when but it eventually will. You wanna get a picture of the economy , go off Reddit crypto. Go outside and talk to ppl. See what stores are closing down in your neighborhood. What stores are opening, what people have an appetite for and what makes em part with their hard earned money. As of today my portfolio has zero crypto.

When the market goes down, which it will due to this administration economic policies, growing wealth inequality and rising prices for goods - crypto will be the first to crash.

HOWEVER, we are in an unprecedented time geopolitically, given Trump's upending of the world order. While Trump is friendlier to crypto in terms of banking and SEC enforcement (which is important), his tariffs, Ukraine policy and it's implications esp for Taiwan, sabre rattling toward allies, his fumbling of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (not buying any additional coins), and his grift in the form of the TRUMP and MELANIA coins and World Liberty Financial have all been very bad for crypto. On balance, so far, the Trump administration has been a negative for crypto and our bags.

All of the above may have disrupted the four-year cycle and completely changed the dynamics of crypto. It's possible Trump may have even killed crypto as we know it.

They buy low and sell high, public buys high and sells low. 

Things ar the macro economic level are uncertain for sure. 

But I will say. For Bitcoin specifically there's tons of bullish news. The FASB accounting rules changing for bitcoin, SAB 121 being repealed, major institutions pushing for Bitcoin to be part of peoples portfolio, mutual funds and pensions seem willing to hold bitcoin. That's leaving out the strategic bitcoin reserves at the nation state level (I'm dubious of that short term)

Comment,1je6y6d,Zeppelin041,1742324053.0,"When you have 60 years of corruption and insane government spending, you end up in a recession since 2023 like we have been in. The fact we got a bull run before the election was amazing, but right now these current politicians that the main stream media likes to lie to everyone about and claim are Hitler actually are trying to fix the debt problem because we are in 37 trillion and the interest alone on that is higher than our defense budget…

But you know, if you listen to the media enough you’ll be fear mongered into selling and hating your life while blaming people and things for the problem that isn’t even the truth.

The fact of the matter is back in 60s policies were made that chased all our manufacturing over seas and then those same countries tariff America more after taking all our jobs…this wrecked the middle class. Following this they took the damn gold standard away and have created even more policies wrecking the middle class like DEI and green new gas, or the department of education which mainly normalized all these policies and taught rewritten history so people would forget.

Back in the 50s before this we were producing 50% of the worlds goods and oils and we tariffed everyone else…todays age the media and globalists will psyop everyone into thinking tariffs bad and orange man Hitler….yet you can’t sit here and deny the fact that DOGE has actually found real corruption with our tax dollars…

And this leads me to the finale, our money is fake, everything about it since the gold standard was taken away made it fake. Every war for the last 30 years has been to keep the dollar as the reserve of the world, not because of what we have been told. They literally just print it anyway yet continue to tax the crap out of us, and we normalized this as well? And yet when we finally get a president that talks about all of this, all of a sudden he is Hitler and a BIGGG problem..

We are basically living in a fall of Rome situation, sponsored by the globalist EU, and instead of people knowing their history, they blame the current sitting politicians that have only been there a couple months…makes sense.

Combine this with the poison water, food, and medical supply and you now have a population thats easy to control and manipulate with IQs dropping quite a bit each generation.

And if you refuse to believe anything I said, do a deep dive on it all, and don’t use google to do so because they are also in on it. And most these socials since monetization now allows you to pay them monthly and pump money into all your posts, letting bots, politics, and the propaganda machine psyop all these platforms with their media attack campaigns and everyone falls for it. 

But if I was any investor I’d pay attention to how countries out there have been forming Bitcoin reserves and how America is the only one that hasn’t, which is why a reserve is being talked about because if America does not they will get left behind. Just like how they wrecked themselves with the fake green new gas while China creates the world’s biggest pollution and has flown ahead of us in everything…meanwhile we are the only country that has been destroying ourselves over “climate change”…which is out of our control and not something we can do if the entire world doesn’t do it too..

That should fundamentally slow down the action on the markets. That said this is still the most risk-on asset class right now. There’s still going to be huge volatility and especially in the next several months and years with the current administration in the US government. Anyone saying they know what’s coming is lying.

Trump’s crypto reserve will certainly create some movement in the markets but most people are even more skeptical of crypto than they already were. I don’t see much upside at the moment, but hey, I’ve been out since Bitcoin hit 70k. The prices right now are definitely not buying prices, either. 

I’m not much of a strategist, frankly I rely on public sentiment, if the market is excited about crypto then you can trust that retail investors will pump the price. I’m not seeing that, instead I’m seeing govt using crypto for bribes and to make easy cash on pump and dumps.

In the last bull market I was lucky with some coins (made a decent investment in AVAX at $8) and the first thing I did was to take my initial investment + some profits and left most of the money staking or invested in some of their protocols. It's much more easy to endure a bear market when you're essentially play with ""free money""... it still sucks when it goes down and gives you hope when it goes up BUT you don't feel a lot of pressure to sell because you have nothing to lose.

Problem is that most people YOLO on crypto (and, unfortunately, in memecoins), they panic sell when it goes 10%-20% down and then get frustrated. OP is almost certainly one of those cases.",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1je6y6d/i_think_im_done/

Comment,1jft6qc,Global_Strain_4219,1742490162.0,"It's okay, thats how you learn. 2300$ is not that much. I have a policy of only trading crypto currencies if I'm mentally prepared for it to go to 0$.

My suggestion is to have some investments in your budget. I have no idea how much you make. Let's say you make 1000$. Have 20% dedicated for investment (200$). Out of those 200$, most of it you put away in a retirement in safe stocks ($VOO in an IRA or 401k, only index funds), let's say maybe 150$. Next you put a little bit in high risk invesments, but still much safer than memecoins. By that I mean bitcoin, ethereum, tesla stock (or other single stocks). Maybe 30$. And finally you have 20$ left, this is what you put towards high speculative things. Dogecoin, PENGU, any NFTs. But those 20$ you have to be mentally ready for it to go to 0$.

This strategy is very good for multiple reasons:

\* you have a safe investment plan, your net worth will grow.  
\* you do put some risk in, so your are not playing completely safe.  
\* this is a DCA, much better and less stressful than trading.  
\* day trading is almost impossible when there are so much insider trading going on",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jft6qc/devastated_i_lost_money_trading_meme_coins/

Comment,1jfkrr9,PeterN23,1742542432.0,"This will be the third post today I have done with this. Just for transparency. You are asking many and varied things but they are fragmented, so it's hard to know what you do or do not understand. For example wallet recommendations - up until recently this really depended on which chain you wanted to transact in Metamask for ETH, Eternl for ADA, Phantom for SOL, etc. Nowadays they are all becoming increasingly multichain which is great, but still you must understand the basics as some wallets are still single chain specific which could lead to issues or even loss of funds. Anyways here's what I am proposing as per the first line in this post:



I was thinking of starting a course for people like yourself to allow them to begin navigating this space, as I think too many are sleeping on crypto - something I feel is the next logical evolution alongside AI. With crypto - it's always best to be cautious but if you're keen to be my guinea pig and I can take some notes as well to then perfect things to create a course. Could be a fit. Message me if you're keen - I will never ask for your money nor seed phrases or similar and if you get even a whiff of any of that then run! Otherwise there's tonnes of things out there that are freely available - however with crypto, at least for myself, I would have loved somebody dedicated to teach me everything and be there to answer questions. There's so much to understand with crypto when you're getting started - wallets, exchanges, the different chains, L1s, L2s, and then later on NFTs, RWAs, DePINS, SocialFi... The learning curve was steep when I started and like many others I learnt by doing, and lost some things in the process. But agree with everyone - never ever accept DMs and always be cautious! Treat everything as a scam until proven otherwise. I just need to start this thing somewhere. My goal is to try out different ways of explaining things and understanding what works best, so that's what I will get out of it.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jfkrr9/studying_crypto/

If you have to ask this question, then you want to stick to established coins (BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP etc), you can do your research on them and choose. If after that research you still don’t know what to buy, then buy BTC.

Depending on your country and tax laws, an alternative is to buy crypto related stock in a tax free investment wrapper. This is much safer with FREE INSURED custody of your funds in most countries.

Comment,1jfkrr9,nickjsul4,1742480789.0,"That’s like me studying what stocks are and how they work and deciding to throw some money at a few random stocks. Entirely ridiculous. You should have spent all of that time learning how to invest in general. Learning how to trade stocks will put you far ahead of all the “buy and hold” clowns on here. And yes buy and hold strategies can play out well but if they don’t you wasted years of your life for nothing. Buy and hold is a GAMBLE. Having a strategy makes you a smart trader and that is not a strategy it’s a bet. 

For me personally im getting into trading Bitcoin futures on coin catch. I’m learning a few basic strategies and I am learning to apply them using paper money (fake money). I will not use real money until I’m consistently profitable. Using real money is a whole other ball game also. 

Best advice I can give is do not invest a single real dollar until you are absolutely positive you know what you’re doing. Having somewhat of an idea is not good enough.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jfkrr9/studying_crypto/

Not everyone I don t like is hitler but there is a measurable swell of nazism/fascism in America right now.

Nazism seemed sensible and appealing to millions of Germans until it crashed down.

It used compelling slogans and clever media.

It effectively vilified moderate and liberal voices and leaders.

It ignored laws or overcame them sudden and shocking expansion of executive power.

There are many people with mixed genitals, like millions of them. Then there’s millions more with more typical genitals but different brain structures and associations and preferences.

Comment,1jergi5,coinfeeds-bot,1742369408.0,"tldr; The North Dakota Senate has passed House Bill 1447, which introduces stricter regulations for crypto ATMs to combat fraud. The bill, approved by a 45-to-1 vote, reinstates a $2,000 daily transaction cap per user and mandates that operators be licensed as money transmitters. It also requires fraud warnings, blockchain analytics for monitoring, and quarterly reporting of transaction data. The bill aims to address rising cryptocurrency fraud, which caused over $6 million in losses in North Dakota in 2023, and now awaits approval from the House and Governor Kelly Armstrong.

Comment,1je8fnp,easily_erased,1742317346.0,"They tried to run an ATM offering on their LAST ticker (still only a few months old) STRK a week ago and placed such a small amount it was like 0.1% of the 21 billion they apparently think the market is going to just gobble up. Now they come back to the market with different terms, because obviously daddy needs his dry powder.

What is the market demanding? ""Declared regular dividends on the perpetual strife preferred stock will be payable solely in cash. "" We don't want your shares anymore Michael. Also there's quarterly payments with heavy penalties for missed payments compounding up to 18%; Saylor's credit rating seems to be going down among smart money. Lastly, the liquidation price is dynamically set as price rises, with any potential dilliution through ATM not counting against it. 

The dynamic liquidation price is the most telling aspect; doing a surprise ATM on the STRK product whose main ""feature"" was a $1000 perpetual strike clearly ruffled some feathers. it looks like institutional investors are only gonna play ball if he gives them significant protections against dillution

A few days later, eager to check on the progress of his investment, he is amazed to learn that the price has now risen to 50 cents per contract, twice the price he paid for his original 100 contracts. Sensing a trend, he steps it up, this time buying 100,000 contracts. The next day, ecstatic to learn that the price per contract has now risen to 65 cents, he gets even more aggressive, buying 1,000,000 contracts. Sure enough, the following day, the price per contract rises to 95 cents, prompting him to order an additional million contracts. The day after that, as rising prices further validate his intuition, he buys yet another million contracts, this time paying $1.25.

The next day, with egg contracts trading at $1.75, he senses that the market has risen too far too fast, and places an order to sell 2,000,000 contracts. After a pregnant pause, his broker replies, ""Sell to whom, you're the egg man!""",38,0,https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/25/03/44378673/strategy-announces-500-million-strf-preferred-stock-offering-to-boost-bitcoin-investments?utm_source=coingecko&utm_campaign=coingecko&utm_medium=coingecko&utm_content=coingecko&utm_term=coingecko

Comment,1je8fnp,critiqueextension,1742317617.0,"Strategy's recent announcement of a 10% dividend on its preferred stock offering has raised concerns among analysts regarding the company's financial viability, as it may echo historical failures of firms with similar high-risk dividend structures, such as Long-Term Capital Management. Critics fear that the firm's reliance on Bitcoin for financial stability could lead to significant risks if market conditions worsen.

Comment,1jec1t8,coinfeeds-bot,1742322637.0,"tldr; The Trump administration plans to acquire Bitcoin as a strategic asset through budget-neutral methods, avoiding taxpayer impact. Bo Hines, executive director of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, revealed this during the Digital Asset Summit 2025. The administration views Bitcoin as a commodity with intrinsic value and aims to treat it like digital gold. Collaborating with the Treasury and Commerce departments, the goal is to acquire as much Bitcoin as possible while fostering innovation in the crypto sector.

Comment,1jeg0ya,coinfeeds-bot,1742332211.0,"tldr; A Coinbase and EY-Parthenon survey of 352 institutional investors reveals strong bullish sentiment on cryptocurrency, with 83% planning to increase allocations in 2023. By 2025, 59% aim to allocate over 5% of their assets to crypto. Stablecoins, DeFi, and tokenized assets are driving adoption, with DeFi engagement expected to triple by 2027. Regulatory clarity is seen as key to further growth, though concerns about regulation, volatility, and custody persist. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins like XRP and Solana remain popular among institutional portfolios.

Comment,1jejxa6,aaj094,1742375427.0,"Isn't the latest STRF preferred stock issue by Strategy a reasonably compelling proposition? It pays a fixed 10% per annum cash dividend (they don't have the leeway of paying dividend in kind using common stock like STRK does) and so they have first claim on any cash left after debt servicing. Further if Strategy ever chooses to miss the dividend, it accumulates for the next period and compounds at 10% + some penalty (upto a max of 18%). Finally, in a liquidation scenario, it shares with STRK first claim on a liquidation value of $100.

So given that Strategy has a huge stack of BTC, doesn't this look like a juicy proposition for STRF holders? They are pretty much going to get made whole even in a very bad scenario (while MSTR shares get obliterated) and till then pay a very juicy 10% fixed yield in cash?

Sure, there is no upside here (though falling interest rates will give some) but rather this is a yield play.",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jejxa6/daily_crypto_discussion_march_19_2025_gmt0/

Comment,1jejxa6,nionios_k,1742511956.0,"Me neither. But I have changed. You see 2.5 years ago i had total savings of 20.000€ and when btc crashed I bought a whole. All that time I was also accummulting small amounts of eth, leading to a couple months ago having 1 btc and 4 eth. I was skeptical of trump and I cashed out everything before inauguration and was lucky enough to time it at the ATH. I made 120k€ and this changed me. Meaning, I can now put money in it and sleep well, and if it dives I can always buy more and STILL have more than my initial investment. All I do after inauguration is just buying and selling 0.5 btc with tp at 500-1000 euros which is easy when you put big money.. e.g 1000€ profit on 0.5 btc at 80k€ is just 2.5% upwards. I believe the sudden etf interest and Trump is no coincidence. They know they can milk a lot of money without consequences and I believe they will take advantage of it in full and give some bonus to potus. Thus, I bet that there is still room for crypto to crash. They will then announce that they are buying and spread hopium to everybody, and just like that 4 years have passed and the next president will sell all the crypto for wellfare and it is going to crash again.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jejxa6/daily_crypto_discussion_march_19_2025_gmt0/

Comment,1jejxa6,xtra_clueless,1742359097.0,"Just because you \*can\* have it doesn't mean it's likely going to happen. But since I am clueless, maybe enlighten me rather insult? QT is the reduction of the money supply to curb inflation. QE is essentially the opposite: expansion of the money supply, which may lead to inflation later on. So it's either one or the other, no? Just the tools are different. 

What are your arguments why QE will be back soon?

Here's why I think it's unlikely:  
The Fed is cautious with lowering interest rates and is concerned about sticky inflation, which is still above the target. QE is usually something they start when interest rates are near zero. The Fed is still in the process of quantitative tightening and this will probably continue until late this year ([though now maybe at a slower rate](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/fed-watchers-see-good-chance-change-balance-sheet-drawdown-2025-03-18/)). The US economic conditions are still decent, incl. job numbers (though this may change later this year.) Even in the worst case scenario where Trump and tariffs causes a recession, I have doubts that the Fed would reverse course immediately, especially given the sticky inflation.",7,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jejxa6/daily_crypto_discussion_march_19_2025_gmt0/

Comment,1jejxa6,Smiling_Jack_,1742360407.0,"OK, 

First off, these quantitative measures are a new tool, one of many that have been spun up by the Fed since '08.

So when people say you need QE or QT for this or that to happen, they're full of shit because we straight up don't enough data. It's a nascent tool. 

The whole reason it started is because financial institutions levered up on long-term duration assets, those lovely MBSs, that turned out to be fucking worthless.  
So when they collapsed, the Fed stepped in to buy them to put in a floor.

And as most folks know, there's nothing more permanent than a temporary solution.

  
The thing is, QE/QT isn't generic open market ops (Fed Funds rate).  
It's not just a simple buy or sell.

Because with the Fed's balance sheet, changes to the **composition** of its assets are just as, if not more important than the overall net change in its value.  
If the fed is buying relatively liquid assets at a great rate than it is letting illiquid assets run off, or even selling, then you can QE while actually reducing liquidity (aka doing what people assume QT does).

tl;dr the QE/QT discussion is far more nuanced than your basic monetary policy.  
AND, it's very new and we do not have nearly enough data to start making conclusions about marginal changes in its policy.",-2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jejxa6/daily_crypto_discussion_march_19_2025_gmt0/

Comment,1jejxa6,biba8163,1742398372.0,"In the 7-8 years since I wrote those comments, things have really changed.  Banks have now realized that Stabelcoins are now the future for cross border payments and remittance:

See JP Morgan's paper about CDBC/Stablecoins:

> ""UNLOCKING $120 BILLION VALUE IN CROSS-BORDER PAYMENTS"" 

https://www.jpmorgan.com/onyx/documents/mCBDCs-Unlocking-120-billion-value-in-cross-border-payments.pdf?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block

Even Ripple realized that Stablecoins are the future:

> Stablecoins like USDC offer a revolutionary pivot... efficiently transfer value across borders, bypassing traditional banking systems and eliminating many associated risks....Lower transaction costs compared to traditional banking. As low-fee alternatives to traditional money transfer methods, stablecoins can facilitate global transfers without foreign exchange fees. As the integration of stablecoins into the banking system continues, they promise to reshape the financial world, offering enhanced efficiency, inclusivity and innovation. This evolution is not just about adopting new technologies but is a step towards a more interconnected and resilient global financial system.

https://ripple.com/reports/the-functional-evolution-of-digital-assets.pdf

Banks are now moving vast amounts of money with their own issued stablecoins and permissioned systems such as:

- JPM Coin from banking giant JP Morgan is a bank coin.  (Note, JPMorgan has rebranded JPM Coin to Kinexys Digital Payments)

- Progmat Coin from Japanese giant Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group is a bank coin.  

You will hear bankers talking about their banking coins, their permissioned institution-to-institution networks that create deep liquidity pools for moving money world wide.  You will never hear these big banks working with Ripple to use XRP.  


> We move 10 Trillion dollars around the world every day.  JPM Coin institution-to-institution solution to major inefficiencies of the current payment system. .  Working in a permissioned environment with companies that are trusted and trust each other.  Where they can move money within the ecosystem 24/7.  Today we move a billion dollars every day for a number of large companies.......the next step is how to bring a retail version of that to consumers.  Obviosly central bank digital currencies are one way to do it but there is also an opportunity for banks to create commercial versions of that.  That is the next version for us for innovation.

> Last year, MAS launched the Global Layer One (GL1) initiative to foster the development of a public permissioned foundational digital infrastructure, upon which commercial networks could be deployed creating an open, digital infrastructure enabling cross border transactions and global liquidity pools. Since the launch, MAS and a core group of global banks, namely BNY, Citi, J.P. Morgan, MUFG and Societe Generale-FORGE, have been leading efforts to define the business, governance, risk, legal and technology requirements of the GL1 Platform.

> The Kinexys Digital Payments removes traditional treasury friction points and is ideal for managing real-time liquidity through cross-border payments beyond currency cut-off or non-banking hours, such as on banking holidays and weekends.

Comment,1jef5yt,HighSeas4Me,1742394136.0,"A few things here, I follow LRC very close, have some minimum spot. A few things with LRC, the GME thing irrelevant, it always was, if anything it just hurt the legitimacy of the actual coin.

The main positive things with LRC specifically is 
1, its still very active on X, thats not majorly significant but it does matter. They constantly post about updates.

2, they have a great war chest from the GME pump so they can stick around thro a down spin.

3, maybe the most significant thing, they did garner some traction as a possibility in facilitating XRP as a partner(this is your unicorn)

4, to this day LRC still flash pumps but is defended by whales quite often, this is usually indicative of a powder keg explosion, assuming u get the spark.

5, and my fav thing about LRC is it has great clear fib lines, if it can get over $.37 anythings possible and if time has showed us anything it has the ability to run there in a day.",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jef5yt/is_lrc_dead_in_the_water_or_is_there_a_slight/

Comment,1jef5yt,fu_paddy,1742332628.0,"I mean...if you need the money then sure sell it. You won't turn profit on the investment, that's for sure. Maybe it can still do a 2x or something, at some point, maybe. Worst case scenario is you lose like what, $90 more? You've already lost 1900. 

Top tier memecoins are down 70-90% from ATH. I'd wait for the week to end, see how this thing unfolds. Then maybe put that 100 in something like PEPE/SPX6900/DOGE/TURBO/WIF/POPCAT or something else with a history, a community and...you know, the vibes. That's a guaranteed 2-6x next time they pump(depending on how this week and month end). I'd rather wait on either one of these than on LRC if I had to turn $100 into $200, that's for sure. Honestly, with this $100 I'd just open a 3-5x no stop-loss long on one of the memes when they finish dumping to a nice support. You've written it off already, might as well do that.

I wish I'd done that instead of buying all those alts, even if some of them were arguably good.

Solana is/was one of the big places people went to make pump and dump memecoins on the cheap, and now it looks like it's being overtaken by Binance - one of the other big places - in terms of transaction volume so those days might also be done for them. It is just transaction volume though so maybe it'll just depend on those new... projects... It's more likely it'll be the next big pump and dump scheme but time will tell, right?

The best coin/project out there is Algorand, at least in regards to scalability, security, and stability (the trilemma)... but nobody gives a shit about that.

The best network 'doing things' I'd argue is Polkadot because it's more focused on interchain operability and connecting that to real world applications, but again, no one really gives a shit about that, because the current atmosphere has been poisoned by pump and dump schemes mainly coming from the Solana and Binance networks.

Comment,1jenmtw,coinfeeds-bot,1742354408.0,"tldr; Native rollups are a proposed framework for Ethereum scaling that integrates rollups directly with Ethereum's core transaction rules. Unlike traditional rollups, native rollups use Ethereum's own verification mechanisms, eliminating the need for external proof systems and governance structures. This approach simplifies development, enhances security, and ensures alignment with Ethereum upgrades. However, they do not address all scaling constraints and may face challenges with compatibility and efficiency. Native rollups represent a secure and streamlined scaling option for Ethereum's ecosystem.

Comment,1jenmtw,HSuke,1742354565.0,"ELI5 on the difference between Based and Native rollups

**Native rollup**:

* L1 validators natively validate L2 transactions within 1 block
* Provides native L1 security for L2s, making them the equivalent of Stage 2 (or Stage 3) rollups. Currently, the most secure rollup in terms of L2beat stages (Arbitrum) is still at Stage 1.
* Native L2s automatically inherit Ethereum updates, so it simplifies the complexity of developing L2s
* Requires a new L1 precompile update (basically an advanced opcode) to Ethereum, so it's still under development. Probably at least a year away
* Current design only works for EVM-equivalent L2s, though there is some discussion among devs about whether to adjust it for EVM-compatible L2s and other designs.


**Based rollup**:

* Instead of centralized L2 sequencing, L1 validators perform the transaction sequencing
* Thus the rollup inherits L1's liveness and censorship-resistance
* It also allows for horizontal scaling across L2s and possible interoperability between L2s
* Taiko is the first Based rollup and has some [additional documentation](https://docs.taiko.xyz/taiko-alethia-protocol/protocol-design/based-rollups/) on how theirs works. Note that theirs is also a Contestable Rollup, so it provides additional L1 security features not necessarily found in Based rollups.",5,0,https://www.bankless.com/read/native-rollups-based

Comment,1jedzfd,KIG45,1742327526.0,">Ethereum’s native token has repeatedly entered oversold territory against Bitcoin in recent months, but the altcoin has yet to show any signs of finding a price bottom. The trading situation is actually quite similar to a previous scenario, and ETH’s market structure suggests it could repeat itself in Q2 to Q3 of this year.

I really hope he is wrong, although everything the analyst says in the article is unfortunately true in my opinion.

But I remain optimistic about Ethereum. 

It can't fail, right?",3,0,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-price-in-cursed-downtrend-which-could-continue-well-into-2025-analyst?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Comment,1jedzfd,coinfeeds-bot,1742327440.0,"tldr; Ethereum's Ether (ETH) is in a prolonged downtrend against Bitcoin (BTC), with analysts predicting the bearish momentum could persist into 2025. The ETH/BTC pair has repeatedly failed to find a bottom, with oversold conditions not leading to recoveries. Technical indicators, including a bear pennant pattern and declining EMAs, suggest further downside risk. Additionally, Ethereum's gas fees and trading activity remain low, and spot ETH ETFs are seeing outflows. Analysts remain cautious, citing an unfavorable risk/reward ratio compared to Bitcoin and other altcoins.

Not sure if you can post links here, but read the Guardian Long Read article ""Accelerationism: how a fringe philosophy predicted the future we live in"" to get a better understanding of it, and what may be happening in America today. It's 7 years old but is surely part of what is happening now.

I've been a liberal crypto guy, predominantly interested in one particular project (not Solana), and had hopes that it was going to improve the world, not knowing anything about accelerationism, but in hindsight, I was  thinking along some of those tropes, especially more transparent governance through blockchain.

Comment,1jdtz8q,Entire-While6265,1742283740.0,"First, I sometimes wonder if actors in ads like this are aware they are spreading non-sense, or if they are inline with the message to begin with. I don't think I could ever act in something like this, even if it was my job.

On an other note, I see how everyone here is calling it a bad take for an ad. I wonder if, even by repulsing most people, attracting a bit more MAGA fanatics could be profitable in the short term. Worst thing that could happen would be that folks already invested in it drop it all at once. But beside that, it must look *really* appealing to the target audience. Since Trump already used Solana to promote his own shitcoins, it might be a real strategy for Solana to go full MAGA and live off of that. Assuming they are totally apolitical or pro-Trump.

It's also a bold move in that it gives one more important point to compare themselves with the concurrents. Choosing a blockchain is not a matter of security, performance or decentralization anymore, it's a political thing (which is oddly contradictory with the message from that ad \^\^).",1,0,https://youtu.be/i6D-j_QXDx0?si=b3Gdd-nJ1UWqbCUl

Comment,1jdtz8q,PandorasBucket,1742408734.0,"I have Bluesky and I see none of that, but small minority groups within parties will always turn on the party. Recently you have Nick Fuentez turning on Trump. The trans super minority doesn't run the democratic party. The the kinds of posts I follow are Robert Reich, AOC, and Bernie Sanders. These people are the actual heart and soul of the current democratic party. Mostly they talk about how the growing wealth divide. AOC is the only one who ever mentions Trans people and it's pretty rare. The main issues in this country are that the quality of life is being lowered for the average people because more money is being funneled to the top 1%. That won't change either. That is the nature of capitalism. That is what the game of monopoly was trying to teach you. Capitalism always ends in feudalism. You must regulate capitalism, bust monopolies and REDISTRIBUTE wealth if you don't want mass starvation. With automation it's only going to get worse. The poor won't even be needed anymore. Do you think no one in the bottom 80% of the country is talented? Of course they are, but they can't go to school and self actualize because all of that requires money. They have to try and feed their families. In all of history the great scientists always came from rich and aristocratic families of leisure. We need universal basic income or we will either have bloody revolution or mass death, or both.

You might ask, why do you support crypto then? Well glad you asked. Our current fiat system is actually another monopoly and crypto allows us to step outside of that monopoly. It allows us to trade outside their monopoly. They print money for themselves. We can create value without having them leach out of our system and when they want to buy into our system we can just make a new system. It's a great tool to fight the ultra wealthy. Ideally we would not use capitalism for any kind of important human organization, but we're still primitive so we need baby steps to get there. All capitalism should be seen as a dangerous hobby at best, like sports betting. We're actually one big human family and there is no reason for us to be playing PVP games when we could actually work together. Unfortunately we have yet so discover the psychopathic personalities are a cancer. As long as we use capitalism as a core organization structure we will continue to reward hostility toward each other.",1,0,https://youtu.be/i6D-j_QXDx0?si=b3Gdd-nJ1UWqbCUl

I'm actually a green party member who only voted democrat to vote for Bernie sanders in 2016. I can't recall him mentioning trans people a single time in that election. If you're seeing democrats talk about trans people then you're seeing it through right wing news outlets bringing up tiny events no one on the left is paying attention to. You're viewing the left through a right wing lens. You're exactly mind controlled. Go to youtube and watch the Meidas Touch news network or Luke Beasly.

I don't think anything I said was being upset, I found it rather funny. I do understand if other people in crypto would look at this and consider it bad for crypto because it associates more clown behavior with crypto in general.


> you’ve got to trash the actor


I have a feeling this guy wasn't hired from the outside, if he was and thought this was a good role to take he has been living his whole life in the trash, he didn't need me to put him there.

CZ highlighted the challenges of succeeding in crypto, requiring extraordinary effort and market knowledge, as Bitcoin trades near $82,930 amid record sector outflows.

Comment,1jdvely,nugymmer,1742299754.0,"Well, I'm starting my DCA into BTC in the not too distant future when finances are looking in better shape. But I have no time for anything else. Because unlike the overwhelming majority of crypto, BTC is actually a commodity - a virtual form of gold in a most portable form.

It hurts to think that, less than 3 years ago, considerably less than 3 years ago, I had $50k that I could have parked into 2 BTC, and today would be well over $200,000 Australian dollars and was, would you believe, over $300,000 Australian dollars just a short while ago. It hurts to think about it because I could have helped my family and friends. I don't care about money as much as some would believe. But having a nice little nest egg to help my family in times of real need would make me feel a lot better knowing that I wouldn't feel ""useless"" in my own terms, if I say so myself. Having a spare 300k would make me useful.

And it turns out being useful is what gives me self-worth. Feeling useless makes me feel worthless.

So I'm doing to slowly DCA into BTC, and I'm going to hold it for as long as I need to, just to ensure that someone else, other than myself, can actually have their needs met. I don't care about my own needs. There are times that people tell me to start looking after number one, but then what? I have a litany of health problems, and money is never going to solve any of them, not ever, so I think the best thing I can do with that money is to store it, invest it, and ensure that it grows, so that if someone in my family is really doing it tough, I can do something to help them out in a material sense.

And this now brings me to my Ethereum ""October 2015"" regret, my oh so biggest regret. I could have so easily snared $10k worth of ETH back then, I could have snared even $15k worth of ETH. How much would that have been at the peak? I'd presume somewhere between 40 and 60 million conservatively. I cannot imagine how helpful I would be if I had that much money to my name, if I were a cash rich multimillionaire. Feeling great about being able to lift the people I give a shit about out of bad situations, bad relationships, bad circumstances.

But alas, here I am, with not much but the shirt on my back. Sure, I have food and shelter, and clothes to wear, so I guess that's a damn sight better than what a lot of people in underdeveloped countries have.

As for being rich, well, that's not really a yardstick, it's more of a relative thing. In the land of the homeless, someone who has a roof over their head is rich. In the land of the starving, he who has food on the table is rich. In the land of the naked and barefoot, he who is clothed and has shoes to wear is rich. Rich indeed.

It's not about money, it's about where you stand among the rest of us. If you have something that most of us don't, then you are damned rich. Simple as that.",7,0,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/binance-ex-ceo-warns-95-170304834.html

Comment,1jdvely,ImMorphic,1742357318.0,"I've been searching but I'll be honest, I've taken notes from excerpts over the years, while reading history of wars and what eventually after them.

In particular, I highly recommend reading into the battle of waterloo and what happens when someone else's courier gets back to you before your own. Won't share too much to leave the excitement for you, if you're into that sort of thing!

I started there and went further down the rabbit hole of searching for documents online, and it does ring true re reserve banks having a bit of an alterior motive longer term. Then when you look into what happens when a country that doesn't have an RB needs help from one that does etc., interesting times ensue.

There are many bad actors at play (just as there are good actors, however intentions of good and bad can depend on what side youre on), no doubt competing with each other - the resources on the table involve us as well however, they're on a whole different scale and it's all intentionally kept divided so as to not reveal 'the hand' for better or worse.

This is how good versus evil is easily dispelled in our world - the same way people let Hitler have his say until it was too late - same story is repeating currently, believe it or not.

History loves repeating itself, I'm just here to observe and learn, take note of what not to do and shun those who would take from others for the sake of it.

Sorry I can't be of more help, but I hope I encourage you to start your own search, maybe with a different tone of course based on your preferences.",1,0,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/binance-ex-ceo-warns-95-170304834.html

Comment,1je01mj,coinfeeds-bot,1742287206.0,"tldr; Crypto.com faced backlash after a last-minute voting surge approved the minting of 70 billion CRO tokens, reversing a 2021 token burn. The proposal aims to create a Cronos Strategic Reserve to fund ecosystem growth, including AI initiatives. Critics argue this undermines trust and decentralization, as Crypto.com’s validators tipped the scales despite opposition. The newly minted tokens will be released over five years, but frustration among CRO holders remains high, with the token's value declining post-vote.

In Proof of Work, those with the hashpower / hardware control the network.

(just check hashrate distribution, Foundry is turning out to be the Monopolyst winner)

In ORV (Open Representative Voting), market-share of the Tokens defines the control over the network. The higher the price of the token, the harder it is to Monopolize it. Bitcoin's security is not tied to its price, but Nano's security is.

Comment,1jf1afr,Void_Sloth,1742406245.0,"This is terrible, Ripple and XRP are extremely dangerous anti-freedom entities. Their success will ensure that the people remain slaves to the banking cartels.

XRP uses ""trusted"" validators, instead of PoW or PoS. Who do you think those ""trusted"" validators are? They are the very same institutions you know to be corrupt and unworthy of your trust. The same institutions that erode our democracy for their own benefit. XRPs design allows them even greater control over the money, and that is the last thing you want if you care about freedom.

The whole point is for it to be trustless because humans have shown time and again they cant be trusted with the control over money. Yet XRP wants to put trust back in.

Comment,1jeav3c,coinfeeds-bot,1742320209.0,"tldr; A recent survey revealed that the risk of a U.S. recession has risen to 36%, the highest level in six months, largely due to concerns over fiscal policies from the Trump administration, particularly trade tariffs. Analysts have lowered GDP growth forecasts for 2025 from 2.4% to 1.7% and predict the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates twice this year. Tariffs are seen as detrimental to inflation, jobs, and growth, with potential costs to households averaging $1,250 annually. Policy uncertainty is damaging investor confidence and economic stability.

Since 2021 the biggest growth in crypto has been in the 2 killer use cases of crypto:

- BTC

- Stablecoins

Excluding BTC/Stablecoins

- The Alt marketcap has shrunk by almost -50%

- The Alt marketcap has shrunk -50% but the total number of coins/tokens has risen from 3,500 to millions

- The shrinking Alt marketcap combined with the explosion of number of Alts have resulted in a massive dilution of liquidity and a effusion of bagholder tears

Comment,1jduxe3,NorskKiwi,1742286838.0,"Few more things to consider:

Originally, Crypto.com had the MCO token as its primary asset. In 2020, it phased out MCO, replacing it with CRO as the ecosystem’s native token after a controversial token swap and one of the largest token burns in history, shifting utility and focus to CRO.

Reduction in Card Staking Rewards: In May 2022, Crypto.com slashed staking rewards for its Visa card tiers. For example, the highest Obsidian tier dropped from 8% to 2% cashback, while lower tiers like Midnight Blue saw rewards cut to 0%, impacting users who had locked up CRO for 180 days expecting higher returns.

Introduction of Reward Caps: Post-lockup, monthly cashback caps were added in June 2022 (e.g., $25 for Ruby Steel, $50 for Royal Indigo/Jade Green), limiting total rewards for users despite their staked CRO, reducing the incentive for holding large amounts.

Shift to Cardholder CRO Staking (2023): Starting December 2023, the CRO Lockup system was replaced with on-chain Cardholder CRO Staking. Rewards became weekly and compounded, but unstaking introduced a 36-day unbonding period, locking rewards longer and reducing liquidity for users post-lockup.

Lowered Exchange Lockup Rewards: In August 2022, CRO lockup APR on the Crypto.com Exchange moved to a tiered system (e.g., 10% APR dropped to as low as 2% for smaller stakes), affecting users who locked CRO for trading fee discounts after their 180-day terms ended.

Elimination of Some Staking Benefits: After initial 180-day lockups, staking rewards for certain card tiers (e.g., Jade Green, Icy White) were phased out entirely by June 2022 for new stakes, leaving only non-staking benefits, devaluing CRO’s utility for long-term holders.

Comment,1jduxe3,coinfeeds-bot,1742265607.0,"tldr; Crypto.com controversially pushed through a proposal to re-mint 70 billion CRO tokens, reversing a 2021 burn intended to permanently remove them from circulation. Despite initial resistance and low quorum, a late surge of votes from Crypto.com-controlled validators secured the proposal's approval. The re-minted tokens will vest over five years for various uses, including a potential CRO ETF. The move has sparked backlash among CRO holders, who feel trust has been broken. A new proposal to burn 50 million CRO was introduced shortly after, further aggravating critics.

Comment,1jduxe3,bigshooTer39,1742350726.0,"Tokens held on a custodial platform are not yours.  They are an IOU.  It’s in the T&Cs.  

If you are “staking” on Crypto.com or Coinbase, you aren’t staking.  You are locking up your tokens in exchange for a % reward.  Crypto.com and Coinbase are skimming the real staking reward.  As a service fee essentially. For convenience.  

Real delegation (staking) can only be done on chain.  Apy is set by the network. Not Crypto.com or coinbase.  You delegate your tokens to a validator which gives you some voting power.  By keeping your tokens on custodial platform, it allows Crypto.com and coinbase to technically stake them on your behalf and therefore inherit your voting power.

Comment,1jdd1xt,NotsoSmokeytheBear,1742234744.0,"I’ve posted the story a couple of times but never with these details. In 2010 I knew a guy named Julian Pringle. He was I think 86 at the time. A Scottish man living in Canada. Retired ex felon with no friends or family. We became friends when I sold him a gpu on kijiji. He offered me 450 bitcoin for the gpu which I’d declined (I’d have sold once it hit $1 and later hated myself even more). I took $150 in cash instead so I could get a tool I needed that day. A torx 5 screwdriver to open my 580. 

Julian was way ahead of his time with crypto making his own cold storage flash drives. he had six or seven PCs mining 24/7 in a seniors home with ac blasting where electricity was covered for him. Rent was about $300 per month all included. He told me he had nothing left but to maybe try various hard drugs before he died so that explains the radio silence that followed a few months later. Before that we had daily coffees. He had been a professor 50 years earlier and he was very tech savvy for his age. He mined bag loads of btc every day and then he died and I never heard from him again. He had zero ties.

Years later I asked the homes owners what they do with someone’s stuff when they pass and it goes straight to the dumpster if there is no one to claim it.

No fires, but I remember a hilarious thread on one mining forum where a whole bunch of us - myself included - admitted that we had each burned out not 1, and not 3, but exactly 2 Kill-a-Watt meters. We commonly used them to monitor how much power our rigs were drawing. The meters would die, we'd complain to Amazon and get a replacement, the replacement would burn out a few weeks later, and at that point we'd read the instructions and discover that you aren't supposed to leave them plugged in long term with a high wattage draw.  

And then there was the ""Often bought with"" screen on Amazon for certain motherboards and graphics cards that listed (literally) a milk crate and a specific resistor along with CPU, GPUs and other hardware....",3,0,https://i.redd.it/1cgo4sar59pe1.png

Comment,1jdnt4n,iwearahoodie,1742277499.0,"It would talk longer than my thumbs are comfortable typing to write it out. There’s lots of podcasts and YouTube videos explaining.

What is a perpetual swap. 
What is a funding rate for a perpetual swap. 

Understand that. 

Then 

How does Uniswap work
How do smart contracts work 
How does DYDX work 
How does Hyperliquid work
How do I interact with smart contracts on chain


Understand those then

Download say, phantom wallet
Withdraw some Solana from an exchange into the wallet 
Find a basic protocol like Kamino

Deposit some SOL into Kamino
Withdraw some SOL from kamino jnto your wallet. 

You just used a smart contract on chain. 


Then 

Go to DRIFT

Deposit some SOL into drift 

Trade the SOL perp, long or shot. 
Close the trade.

Comment,1jdnt4n,Secularnirvana,1742279481.0,"As others have said it's all on chained and it's an algorithm based on the collateral you posted. Imagine this

You deposit $100 dollars, you make a 50x leverage long bet. If BTC goes up 2%, your position is now worth $200, because of the 50x leverage (1% real move is a 50% move for you). However, since you only have $100 posted, once BTC is down say 1.99%, the system auto liquidates your deposit, that is you're down $100, which the system took to cover your position. 

So using $1m somebody can control a $40m dollar position using 40x leverage, but that means very small percentage shifts going against them can liquidate the position. There is no trust required, because the system liquidates you before you cross the threshold of not having enough to cover your losses.

I do agree with the other users that mentioned you should look into decentralized exchanges, perpetuals, AMMs, it's super interesting stuff.

Comment,1jem11c,AvatarOfMomus,1742353890.0,"Here's a scenario that probably kills it in somewhat short order...

If a big enough wallet belonging to an institution gets hacked, think something worth high 8 digits, but definitely 9-10 digits in value at the time. Then all that gets transfered to a wallet associated with a country (or a group in that country) where Western law enforcement has zero chance of getting it back. Think North Korea, Iran, Russia, etc.

At that point either the institution puts pressure on the Bitcoin maintainers to do a hard fork or rollback of the chain, which probably undermines the trust of everyone who isn't a major institution or billionare, or they see institutions spook and flee the market as they see how vulernable their tokens are to hacking.

The only scenario I see that doesn't nuke the market after a hack like that is either the institutions do *nothing*, which seems incredibly unlikely, or they do a massive astroturf campaign to keep the small wallets on side when they get things ""fixed"" on-chain.",5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jem11c/what_are_the_arguments_against_bitcoins_long_term/

What is the social consequence of the hash rate going down, as previous PoW wars were partially won on the hash rate? Will other PoW coins get more attraction if BTC hash rate caters?

The entire value proposition of bitcoin is that it will continue to go up in price. That is 100% of the reason anyone buys it.

We have saylor buying gorillions, the US gov creating an SRB, and price still cant go up. If there is truly not enough demand to outpace mining emissions so that people no longer have faith their investment will continue increasing at a rate greater than other investments then they will just rotate to those other assets such as equities.

Theoretically yes. But it's very difficult to be away from capital controls. More and more countries are introducing regulations to track taxation and usage. Unless Bitcoin is completely off central exchanges and everyone agrees to carry out transactions purely with Bitcoin and never convert it to fiat, we will always have capital control. Even if you can buy a house with Bitcoin in the future, there will still be capital control on it.

The freely moving around is a problem that can be solved. Most countries already have systems in place for instant money transfers within the country.

Comment,1jem11c,HSuke,1742351933.0,"1. Due to soft forks, Bitcoin has the slowest updates. It takes on average 5 years for nodes and miners to pick up a Bitcoin update (e.g. Segwit, and Taproot), and about 20-30% of nodes are many versions behind on Bitcoin Core. Most exchanges still don't support Taproot addresses 4 years after it was released. About 1/3 of Bitcoin's supply is stored in vulnerable old addresses like P2PK. There's no way to secure them unless their original owners transfer them to a new address, and I don't think Satoshi is coming back. Bitcoin would need to hard fork and CONFISCATE the UTxOs of the older transactions to prevent them from getting stolen. Confiscation of crypto is extremely controversial.
1. Probably, but another 60-80% drop is going to hurt.
1. Very likely within 10-30 years considering how quickly Bitcoin's security budget is declining (already down 50% in the past 4 years).

Bitcoin is not deflationary. It is inflatinary at a continuallly shrinking rate which makes it deflationary vs fiat currency but that isnt the same thing as true deflation. There are actual deflationary cryptocurrencies as well. Check out $rlb. People want to shield themselves from inflation but they will only do it in bitcoin if bitcoin actually continues to go up against their currency which so far it has but again it’s providing diminishing returns which is concerning. The only way bitcoin shields you from inflation is if it keeps going up",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jem11c/what_are_the_arguments_against_bitcoins_long_term/

Yeah, lightning is just too clunky for normal users to get adoption. 

However, the space has invested a lot in rollups, so Bitcoin can piggyback off that. But there is a lot of opposition to putting OPCAT into Bitcoin.

> Ethereum basically exists because there was both not an upgrade path and not a cultural willingness to change the protocol.

Yes. So it was terrible for ETH to decide not to fix its main net problems and go ossify like Bitcoin. Now they are changing the roadmap to scale ETH - bullish things.

Comment,1je4ph9,coinfeeds-bot,1742304037.0,"tldr; A Brazilian federal deputy, Luiz Philippe de Orleans e Bragança, has proposed legislation (PL 957/2025) to allow partial salary payments in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The bill mandates at least 50% of wages to be paid in Brazilian real, with the remainder optionally in digital assets. Full crypto payments are prohibited for most workers but allowed for freelancers and expatriates. The proposal aims to boost Brazil's fintech sector, attract investment, and enhance employer-employee contractual freedom, drawing inspiration from countries like Japan and Switzerland.

Comment,1jdh0qh,dougie-d,1742236458.0,"Chainlink unlocks and sells some of its LINK tokens every few months to fund development, partnerships, and expansion. Some people don’t like this because it adds more LINK to the market, which can push the price down in the short term.

But there’s also a good side:
	•	The money funds growth, like new partnerships, tech improvements, and making Chainlink more useful.
	•	It’s a slow release, not a huge dump all at once like some other projects.
	•	If Chainlink keeps expanding, the demand for LINK could eventually outgrow the sell pressure.

So, while it may hurt price short-term, the goal is to build long-term value by making Chainlink essential for Web3 and traditional finance.",16,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jdh0qh/memecoins_are_crashing_what_are_your_favorite/

Comment,1jdh0qh,dougie-d,1742236259.0,"Imagine blockchains are like super secure computers, but they have one big problem—they can’t access real-world information on their own (like prices, weather, or sports scores). That’s where Chainlink comes in. It’s like a trustworthy internet for blockchains, securely bringing in real-world data so smart contracts can actually be smart.

Why It’s a Big Deal:

Keeps DeFi running – Powers price data for apps like Aave and Synthetix.

Fair randomness – Makes sure NFT drops and blockchain games are truly random.

Connects blockchains to the real world – Used by banks, enterprises, and even Swift to bring traditional finance (TradFi) on-chain.

Helps blockchains talk to each other – With CCIP, different blockchains can now securely send data and assets to one another.

Without Chainlink, most crypto projects wouldn’t work as they do today. It’s not just another coin—it’s the glue holding Web3 together.",10,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jdh0qh/memecoins_are_crashing_what_are_your_favorite/

Some of are just lying.  Others are already fully implemented and there isn't any ""there"" there anymore(look at TRAC or anything related to payment processing like XLM).  The third bucket is ""tech for tech's sake"" where you have an application or idea but implementing it would crash the economy/it can't make money(this is anything privacy related considering most of our big IT businesses require massive amounts of customer data or they will fold).


I know of maybe one asset that has a use case that is being monetized and won't destroy the economy and I can't recommend it because the developers seem to actively hate their investors and you need to be real good at dealing with crypto to work with the asset in such a way that you can make money.",3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jdh0qh/memecoins_are_crashing_what_are_your_favorite/

On the other hand, the Brave browser itself actually fixes real issues. It blocks ads, protects your privacy, lets you watch videos without annoying ads, and even lets you play YouTube videos in the background without paying for YouTube Premium. It’s got a clean, smooth interface since it’s based on Chrome, and it’s super user-friendly. That’s why people keep using it—it solves problems people care about.

Comment,1jdh0qh,alexzim,1742236923.0,"TON = Telegram

Lower goal: TON is not a real crypto, but rather a tool for app monetization. Not like it wouldn't be possible to do all that without blockchain, but like, since it's somewhat trendy, why not. If you're from a Western country, you'll have have to believe me how big Telegram is in some of Eastern countries. I know it's just a crypto spam and drug dealing messenger to you, but here it's way way more.

Higher goal: TON is still not a real crypto, but all of the above + bridging some of the more popular crypto projects to a wider audience + some kind of payment processing for developing markets.

Dream goal: Telegram is like WeChat in some countries and people pay for stuff with TON's payment processing system

As of right now, Telegram is perhaps the only thing out there that brings crypto to a wider user base, who'd normally didn't give a damn. They built in a wallet into Telegram. It's very lowkey atm, kind of feels like they're live testing different approaches and trying to not scare users away with it.

An example from my life:

A friend of mine is in Russia, they can't top up Steam without different workarounds. Usually it's a wack third-party service that takes a hefty commission. I showed him a Telegram bot where he can top up his Steam with just a few clicks using UST on his TON wallet in Telegram. A person who didn't give a damn about crypto yesterday is using it now. Actually using it, not like people who buy Bitcoins and wait till the price goes up, no, uses it as a currency to pay for a service. A dude who didn't care at all before.

Edit: by saying ""not a real crypto"" I mean that it's pretty much wrapped around Telegram and its team. Also a large amount of supply belongs to the creators.

Not 0% then, is it. I’m sure you’ll say it’s ‘splitting hairs’, but if you had to pay some arbitrary fee every time you moved your fiat, I imagine you wouldn’t be pleased. Crypto should aspire to be at least as good as fiat in this regard imo

Comment,1jdh0qh,ImpossibleCoffee91,1742238576.0,"XMR does privacy better than bitcoin, that is an undisputed fact, but that's really where all the positives of XMR end. now, BTC will never be as private as XMR, but it has achieved almost the same level of privacy on lightning network with the additional benefit of 0% fees and instant transactions.

1: the issue with XMR is, that it currently has an unlimited cap, and even though you only can mine 0.6XMR per block, unlimited is still unlimited. bitcoin has a fixed supply, making it more of a scarce asset

2: another issue with XMR is, that the network is not highly active(compared to BTC or many other coins for example). if by any chance XMR was to become more used around the world, the equipment cost needed to run XMR nodes would increase drastically, turning it from a decentralized project into centralized one(because the equipment cost gets so high that normal people can't afford to run nodes from home anymore). also, don't quote me on this, but the transaction fees would also increase beyond what bitcoin has if XMR was to have similar network activity as BTC from my understanding.

3: thirdly, the privacy issue. XMR most certainly does privacy much better than bitcoin, but it also comes with downsides. BTC ledger and transactions are all public information, which is very convenient when you need to confirm transactions, or just want to see if there's any shady business going on. 

XMR it's all hidden, so technically speaking you can't even tell how much the team and insiders have allocated at the beginning. yes, there was 0% premine according to research, but there's really zero ways to prove, so you are putting trust to a 3rd party in this case.

4: XMR has done many hard forks since inceptions, and who knows how many times it will happen again. last fork was on **13th August, 2022** based on my google search, whereas bitcoin had one in 2010 that satoshi himself patched if I recall correctly. this in a way could be considered a good thing, but the thing is that with every hard fork there has to be some trade-offs.

\------------------------

again, I don't hate XMR, and I really do believe that there is a good use case for XMR, and the people who hold XMR generally speaking are smart, educated and privacy minded people, unlike certain individuals(XRP gang) that love centralization and bank adoption and their freedoms being taken away. 

XMR does so many things great, and right now without a doubt is the more superior compared to bitcoin when it comes to privacy, but as an overall asset when all things are taken into consideration, bitcoin is still the king. everything I listed is easily available information, but when you start to dig deeper, it becomes even more obvious why bitcoin is better, and the reason I know all of this is, because I used to own XMR in the past.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jdh0qh/memecoins_are_crashing_what_are_your_favorite/
Comment,1jdh0qh,rubyredhead19,1742237085.0,"Monero (XMR) is often considered technically superior to Bitcoin (BTC) in certain aspects, particularly regarding privacy, fungibility, and scalability. Here are some key arguments:

1. Stronger Privacy Features
	•	Ring Signatures: Monero uses ring signatures to mix a user’s transaction with others, making it difficult to determine the sender.
	•	Stealth Addresses: Every Monero transaction generates a unique, one-time address, ensuring that recipient details remain private.
	•	Confidential Transactions (RingCT): Conceals transaction amounts, preventing third parties from seeing how much Monero was sent.

2. Better Fungibility
	•	Fungibility means that each unit of a currency is indistinguishable from another. Since Bitcoin transactions are public, certain coins may be “tainted” (e.g., from hacks or illicit activities), leading to blacklisting by exchanges.
	•	Monero’s built-in privacy ensures that all coins are indistinguishable, making it fully fungible.

3. Adaptive Block Size for Scalability
	•	Monero has a dynamic block size that adjusts based on network demand, allowing it to scale more flexibly than Bitcoin’s fixed 1 MB blocks.
	•	Bitcoin struggles with congestion, leading to high fees and slower transactions during peak usage.

4. Better Transaction Cost Efficiency
	•	Monero transactions are designed to be cost-effective, with fees that adapt to network conditions.
	•	Bitcoin often faces higher fees, especially during periods of high activity, due to its limited block space.

5. ASIC Resistance for Decentralization
	•	Monero employs the RandomX mining algorithm, which is designed to be ASIC-resistant, promoting fair mining on consumer-grade CPUs.
	•	Bitcoin mining is dominated by specialized ASIC hardware, leading to centralization in mining pools.

6. More Private and Untraceable Blockchain
	•	Bitcoin’s blockchain is fully transparent, meaning anyone can track transactions and wallet balances.
	•	Monero transactions are private by default, making it nearly impossible to link addresses or trace transaction histories.

7. Deniability and Security
	•	Because of its privacy features, Monero provides plausible deniability, meaning users cannot prove (or disprove) their transaction history.
	•	Bitcoin users can be subject to analysis and surveillance, potentially exposing them to censorship or legal risks.

8. No Hard-Coded Supply Cap Visibility
	•	While Bitcoin has a well-known supply cap of 21 million, Monero’s supply is not fully transparent due to its privacy design.
	•	However, Monero has a tail emission policy that ensures a small, predictable block reward continues indefinitely (0.6 XMR per block), helping to incentivize miners long-term.

9. Decentralization Beyond Mining
	•	Monero developers prioritize privacy and decentralization, often making network upgrades via hard forks to improve privacy and security.
	•	Bitcoin’s development is more conservative, with upgrades like Taproot taking years to implement.

While Bitcoin remains the dominant cryptocurrency due to its first-mover advantage, Monero is technically superior in privacy, fungibility, and scalability. However, this comes at the cost of reduced transparency, which some institutions and governments oppose.",0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jdh0qh/memecoins_are_crashing_what_are_your_favorite/

lightning transactions are indeed instant and final(the same 0.1-1sec rule), with no possibility of reversing the transactions once it's sent. can you link me the source where it says that settlements are final only once the channel is closed? 

0% is 0% if anyone wishes to create their own lightning channel and set the fee to 0%. on a public channel, such as ""Wallet of Satoshi"", you don't have to start up your own channel and instead use a public one where the fee is 1sat($0.000843). 

I do agree with you that it is a valid concern, because obviously ""$0.000843"" is not 0% and will accumulate into a larger sum over time, and is definitely not something that I would consider as ""taking the piss"". but like I said, it's up to you if you want to use a public channel or a private one created by someone you either know, or one that you create yourself with 0% fees.

what I do however consider as ""taking the piss"" is pointing out that ""hey, 0.1sec is not instant"", because it really is instant and final if you exclude the internet speed limitations that every other coin that claims to have instant transactions also have. just like your Nano coin that you are heavily invested in has that same 0.1-1sec finalization once the servers receive your request to send/receive money.",0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jdh0qh/memecoins_are_crashing_what_are_your_favorite/

It's called debating your opinions, it's not resistance lol. STOP RESISTING!!!!

> it shows that these people are 100% invested in XRP, ETH, XMR, and in your case, Nano, which ticker is XNO if I looked it up correctly.

You're commenting on a Cryptocurrency subreddit, it shouldn't surprise you that people are looking into alternatives to BTC. Go over to the Bitcoin sub if you want to participate in an echo chamber. FWIW I'm not 100% in any of those you listed, but I like ETH/XMR and am quite active in the Nano sub. Been in this space since 2017, I was heavy in BTC until Jan when I exited my position (thank fuck).

> lightning transactions are indeed instant and final(the same 0.1-1sec rule), with no possibility of reversing the transactions once it's sent. can you link me the source where it says that settlements are final only once the channel is closed?

By design, LN transactions aren't recorded to the main BTC blockchain ledger (i.e., fully settled) until the channel is closed. It's fair enough if this doesn't irk you. There are many shortcomings with LN, you can read them about here but Google will throw up a bunch:

https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/lightning-network-overpromised-underdelivering-stefano-virgilli-dp5tf#:~:text=%2D%20The%20Problem%20for%20Lightning%3A%20This,channels%20or%20create%20fraudulent%20transactions.

> I do agree with you that it is a valid concern, because obviously ""$0.000843"" is not 0% and will accumulate into a larger sum over time

My concern with micro-fees is less the cost aspect and more the inconvenience of being charged them in the first place tbh. It also introduces a dust problem (small amounts of un-spendable crypto) though again, not a huge deal at the moment with BTC. 

>  just like your Nano coin that you are heavily invested in has that same 0.1-1sec finalization once the servers receive your request to send/receive money.

Let's go back to your original point:

> all these coins that claim cheap & fast transactions have already been achieved on bitcoins lightning network, but done better

...this simply isn't true, which is why I commented in the first place. Nano for example is fully settled on L1 with sub-second finality, is decentralised, energy efficient, and as it isn't working on a second layer there's no need to jump through hoops with opening/closing channels or using custodial wallets etc. It's also actually zero fee, as in literally zero, as in it costs you nothing to send. The fees never fluctuate because it's always free. Objectively better than Bitcoin's LN in every metric except liquidity. And that's just Nano, a pretty much forgotten 2017 dinocoin. There are other competitors that are also better than LN imo 

If it's not clear: I find LN inconvenient in general, which is a large part of my distaste for it. That said, this is all kinda moot anyway, as nobody is using any of this shit for anything other than price speculation/gambling.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jdh0qh/memecoins_are_crashing_what_are_your_favorite/

They engineer token swaps that appear as bad trades, losing money on purpose, but actually profit through their own trading bots. This tactic turns illicit funds into seemingly legitimate profits, bypassing detection. The scheme involves stablecoins like USDC and USDT, decentralized exchanges, and trading bots exploiting blockchain arbitrage techniques.

Comment,1jesx2z,Life-Duty-965,1742377589.0,"It's gambling but slower.

It's weird that people think its slow movement means it is a sure thing. 

 It is inevitable, like Thanos lol

It's slow rise is likely to be followed by a sharp collapse.  Particularly when this buying community eventually flips and wants to start pulling their ""wealth"" out of the system.

It has to happen.  They will stop earning.  The buys of $100s stop.  The sells of $1000s start.

It doesn't really matter what the price is at the time.  Each seller needs buyers with 10x more cash available. If they aren't there then they don't get to sell.  Simple as that.

Yes it's a gamble.  You just don't know if you are a winner or a loser until a decade or two has passed.

Although there is one way to guarantee being a winner....  Sell now.  Most are likely still in profit.

Sell now.  Win.  

Go and invest in a low cost global tracker.

I opened a new ISA after the pandemic and it's up 87% percent.  The platform is fee free and an ISA is the UKs tax free savings wrapper.  I pay no tax on it.

I only hold BTC because I'm a lucky 2014 buyer. I sell my CGT free allowance each year.  

I wouldn't buy more.  It's not even attractive, even if I believed it won't inevitably collapse.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jesx2z/question_for_economistexperts_what_are_the_best/

Among individuals with at least $1 million in investable assets, 26% own cryptocurrency, compared to the national average of 21%. Additionally, 38% of high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) expect to include crypto in their portfolios, with younger HNWIs showing greater interest. Factors like geopolitical tensions, inflation, and Bitcoin ETF approvals are increasing crypto interest among affluent investors, signaling its growing role in investment portfolios.

1. They already existed, they just found another way to take place. Also, this is just a personal opinion, but if you get scammed you did not deserve to keep that money in the first place.

2. 99% of scammers don't use cryptos to steal ""grandma's money"" they use gift cards or they just transfer the money to some nigerian or indian bank.

3. They already existed tho, do you think crime appeared after cryptos? Did they make it easier? Sure, but I'd much rather have scammers and thieves use the same systems that I use rather than having a government that could see and block all of my accounts and take my money away for whatever reason. That and print so much of my money that  I could buy a frozen pizza for 2B USD by next week. Where and what I do with my money is no one's business, imagine if they asked to monitor and control to that degree other things you possess such as your toilet, every time you use it a person pops up asking what you are using it for and they will stay there watching you till you are finished, and you better do finish quickly because they are allowed to steal it from you at any time.  
That or a car, imagine you are eacaping the police and you can just turns off and locks itself so you cannot escape, a retard would say ""cool now criminals can't escape anymore"", but in reality that's just a sophisticated way to kill political dissidents, journalists, politicians, even just people the police doesn't like. ""Oh yes the car malfunctioned at steered in front of a 5 tons truck"".

4. It's like saying that prisons are a waste if food and water,  if you don't kike it you'll deem everything related to it as useless. It's useful because it keeps the net secure but you don't really care, do you?",0,0,https://i.redd.it/oseo2e9tk4pe1.png

Comment,1jecg0k,coinfeeds-bot,1742323803.0,"tldr; Xapo Bank, based in Gibraltar, has launched Bitcoin-backed USD loans to provide liquidity options for customers without selling their Bitcoin. Eligible users can access up to $1 million in credit by using Bitcoin as collateral, receiving up to 40% of its value in USD. The loans aim to encourage long-term Bitcoin holding and reduce sell pressure during market uncertainty. Unlike failed crypto lenders like BlockFi and Celsius, Xapo operates as a fully licensed bank, potentially offering more stability in its offerings.

Comment,1jdpwcq,coinfeeds-bot,1742251236.0,"tldr; Bitcoin is showing signs of a bullish divergence, with increased activity from whales and technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index suggesting a potential price reversal. Analysts predict Bitcoin could attempt to breach the $100,000 mark if it closes above $84,000 by month-end. Whale accumulation during price declines historically precedes rallies. However, macroeconomic factors, including the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee meeting, could influence Bitcoin's trajectory depending on interest rate policies.

Comment,1jdrtl0,ftball21,1742319208.0,"Got an email from Fidelity a couple hours ago about strategy’s new stock offering

The offering is a $100 stated amount perpetual preferred stock with a 10% dividend per annum that is non-rated (NR/NR).  Strategy has applied to list the perpetual preferred on the NASDAQ under symbol “STRF”.”

And with that, the largest crypto *leverage* cycle kicks off on nasdaq lol. This cycle is far from over but prepare yourself because the most difficult part is de risking towards the peaks.

I have notes in my phone of addresses/sell points that I’ve been building since depths of bear mkt.

Why? Mental exercise: I imagined I am just entering the market and want to build a portfolio from scratch. Is SOL the kind of token I would buy right now? Do I think it has more upside or downside in the coming months?   
A: I think it's more likely to drop further. The SOL meme gambling is pretty much over. I doubt the tariff situation will be solved easily in a few months, Trump likes them too much and is stubborn af.

But you do you.  We all have things we value in life and loved ones and time are more precious and scarce than BTC.  My favorite BTC OG I think was transgender and his/her moon sex change operations -- not necessarily getting rich.  Here is an americanpegasus post from 10 years ago in 2015:


> The next bubble, the $10k - $25k one will be epic... And horrible.

> Basically, we are at a situation where bitcoin is becoming a precious, desirable, and scarce resource... But people just haven't realized it yet.

> And when they do, it won't be a slow and steady March upward. It will be a monumental movement that will leave our heads spinning. One day we will go from $300 to $350, and we'll all be smiling and patting ourselves on the backs

> Many panic and sell on the way up... And truthfully I don't know how high the next bubble can take bitcoin... At $10k the ""market cap"" will be about $150 billion... That's a lot, but about the valuation of a single large company.

Comment,1jdrtl0,Euphoric-Nose-2219,1742342692.0,"Bukele has already been instituting colossal reforms for El Salvador's prison systems in an attempt to curtail the cartels and terrorists. He's been leading brutal national level crackdowns for quite some time alongside his Bitcoin aspirations.

The US is trying to get extradite many illegal and legal immigrants rapidly and is focused on those with criminal ties or histories. These styles of Executive Orders and special procedures like non-domestic detention can bypass typical restraints like due process and appeals.

These two interests aligned where Bukele earns an incredible amount of political favor from the US and the current administration (likely alongside more tangible rewards) to take in criminals that the US would struggle to return to Venzuela. Their common interests of targeting cartels, and other domestic policies made this a very favorable deal for both. The terms either exceeded Bukele's principles or he doesn't see them as a violation of the same ideals that justify his moves towards cryptocurrency.

Comment,1jdrtl0,PeachScary413,1742318098.0,"Your analysis is spot-on—the dot plot release and Fed messaging tomorrow could be a pivotal moment for markets. Here's how I see the dynamics playing out:

**1. Dot Plot Expectations:**  
The 3-4 cut baseline is already partially priced in, so anything below that threshold (≤2) would force a violent repricing. A 0-cut scenario would be a nuclear scenario for risk assets—BTC testing $70k (or lower) seems likely in that case, as it would crush the ""liquidity pivot"" narrative driving the rally. That said, 0 cuts still feels extreme unless CPI/employment data suddenly reverses. The Fed might hedge by keeping 2024 projections vague while emphasizing data dependency.

**2. Tone > Numbers:**  
Even if the dot plot shows 2-3 cuts, *hawkish framing* (""higher for longer,"" inflation stickiness, resilient labor market) could override the headline figure. Powell’s presser will be critical—if he downplays cuts or emphasizes upside risks (e.g., oil prices, wage growth), equities and crypto could sell off sharply. Watch for phrases like ""premature to ease"" or ""lack of progress on inflation.""

**3. QT Guidance:**  
A timeline for tapering balance sheet runoff ($95B/month) would be a dovish signal, as ending QT sooner preserves liquidity. This could partially offset hawkish rate messaging. If they delay QT talks (focusing on rates first), it removes a potential bullish catalyst. The market is underpricing this lever—don’t sleep on it.

**4. BTC Implications:**  
Crypto remains a liquidity play. If the Fed shatters 2024 rate cut hopes, the short-term pain could be severe, but the longer-term bull case (ETFs, adoption) isn’t dead unless macro enters a 2022-style ""inflation crisis 2.0."" A dip to $70k might attract institutional bids (MicroStrategy, ETFs). The real danger is a *sustained* hawkish shift crushing risk sentiment into Q3.

Bottom line: The market is positioned for a dovish hold. Any deviation toward hawkishness (in dots, language, or QT delays) could trigger a broad correction. Stay nimble—volatility will be the winner tomorrow.",0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jdrtl0/daily_crypto_discussion_march_18_2025_gmt0/

Be prepared to see that Bitcoin investment go into the red for some time, but don’t sell there whatever you do, just buy more if possible. Make it a game to get your BTC buy average as low as possible, if you have liquid cash, BTC crashes are your friend.

another aspect of this is we don't know how often whales people gamble like this as most leverage trading is on cexs. a $500m 40x short is obviously extreme, but exchanges don't publish accurate liquidation data, i think bybit is the only one that does and that only started recently. we're only talking about this because the trade is public, im sure if you could see every cex leverage trade you could find a million examples of stuff that looks like insider trading where really it was just people getting lucky",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jdrtl0/daily_crypto_discussion_march_18_2025_gmt0/

Please, tell me more about how gold is used in electronics, medicine, and space tech—I’ve never heard that before. I mean, it’s not like central banks hoard it or investors use it as a hedge against economic collapse or anything. Clearly, the real reason people buy gold is because they love well-conductive circuit boards.

Yes, gold has industrial uses. But let’s not pretend its main value isn’t financial. If people wanted it just for tech, we wouldn’t be seeing vaults full of bullion and skyrocketing prices when the economy dips.

Bitcoin's ""objective value"" comes from its built in scarcity and its secure, trustless, decentralized protocol. 


The capped supply and transparent, verifiable rules and ledger ensure that anyone can confirm a transaction and making counterfeiting/doublespending a problem of the past. 


Being able to safe and securely move your money across to the world for nearly nothing is of MASSIVE VALUE. Very obvious to a lot of people but also not obvious to Americans and the like, who havent had to deal with inflation or having to move money back to your family back home.

Comment,1jd8e5t,babyybilly,1742219570.0,"Cool. You also called gold a ""semiconductor"".  There are idiots everywhere.. it also seems you dont understand ""objective"" 


You claim Bitcoin has ""no objective value,"" yet you conveniently ignore the fact that gold’s value is just as arbitrary when you strip away historical inertia.  Gold’s “objective value” is a myth. Its worth comes from perception, scarcity, and network effects.. just like Bitcoin. If industrial use dictated value, copper or silver would be superior!! This is the point you dont comprehend. 




Bitcoin’s value isn’t opinion.. it’s verifiable fact. Its fixed supply, transparent issuance, and immutable code guarantee scarcity and security. These aren’t abstract concepts; they’re measurable properties that yield real-world impact.




You dismiss Bitcoin because it’s digital, yet its effects are tangible. Gold is heavy, slow, and easy to seize (see Executive Order 6102). Bitcoin is scarcer, more portable, and unstoppable. Your gold can be confiscated easily, your Bitcoin cannot.

Comment,1jdmc06,Numerous_Wonders81,1742242823.0,"Tokenized treasuries are just traditional financial assets wrapped in blockchain tech, which makes them fundamentally different from crypto-native assets like Bitcoin.

The real issue is whether tokenized assets are just repackaging the old system or actually revolutionizing finance.

🔥 The Real Problem with Tokenized Treasuries
They’re Still Centralized → Unlike Bitcoin, tokenized treasuries are controlled by centralized institutions like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and the U.S. government. You’re still trusting the same financial system, just with a blockchain wrapper.

They Don’t Solve Inflation or Currency Debasement → If U.S. dollars lose value due to inflation, then tokenized treasuries (which are just on-chain bonds backed by USD) also lose purchasing power over time.

They Depend on Government Debt → The entire premise is built on U.S. Treasuries, which means they rely on government borrowing. If debt markets collapse or the Fed changes interest rates, these assets are just as vulnerable as traditional finance.

They’re Not Decentralized Money → Unlike Bitcoin, Algorand, or Hedera, tokenized treasuries aren’t an alternative to the system—they’re just making the system more efficient for banks while keeping control out of the hands of everyday people.",4,0,https://thedefiant.io/news/defi/blackrock-s-buidl-and-ondo-crack-usd1-billion-as-tokenized-treasuries-hit-all-time-high

Comment,1jdnne5,coinfeeds-bot,1742245241.0,"tldr; Bitcoin has faced significant sell-side pressure, particularly from short-term holders, as its price dropped 13.5% in the past 30 days and over 29% from its January peak. Institutional inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have slowed, with nearly $1 billion exiting last week. Sentiment indicators like the Fear & Greed index have hit multi-year lows, further driving selling pressure. Analysts suggest that a bullish reversal may depend on renewed demand from long-term holders or institutional investors at lower price levels.

As I said, mindlessly harping, ""Durr, but all time high"" doesn't help your case.

My ""counter argument"" is that you haven't made any argument. You've pointed to a number and claimed, ""Durr, it's high"" as proof that ""the dollar is in a bubble.""

Comment,1jdfqet,HODL_monk,1742451496.0,"The real problem is more, what actual use is there, for an AI agent to blow your sats on ? I remember this guy posting how he was upset that the AI trading agents offered by his exchange seemed to always be losing money over the long term. Of course, if the exchange could just trade with itself and make free money, why would they give that service to their customers ? The only reason for retail to get these agents was for the exchange to make more trading fees off of them buying and selling a lot, which is why they can never make net sats for the end users ! If everyone can just make free sats with their AI agents while they sleep, then no one can, because there are only so many sats out there, and no one wants to lose their sats to some glorified chatbot ! This is the same logic that doomed Celsius. How can everyone just earn even 3 % on their bitcoin every year, when there are only so many sats out there ? I actually realized this issue, but didn't come to the logical conclusion that the whole thing must either be a scam, or so risky that all the profits will go up in flames at some point.",1,0,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-agent-tokens-lose-21percent-zhao-urges-utility-focus

Comment,1jdugyp,coinfeeds-bot,1742263839.0,"tldr; Hyperliquid, a blockchain network specializing in trading, has enabled traders to track and target crypto whales with leveraged positions, potentially liquidating them. This transparency allows coordinated efforts to trigger stop-loss levels, democratizing tactics once reserved for market-making desks. A recent example involved traders attempting to liquidate a whale's $368M Bitcoin short position, echoing the GameStop short squeeze dynamics. Analysts suggest this activity could shift market power but warn of potential risks and strategies like self-liquidation.

Bearish sentiment CURRENTLY is the highest its been SINCE the very beginning phase of the 2022 stock market crash. Which would explain we still have 6 months of downside to go. This is when nasdaq finished the year down 35% (16k-11k)

During this time we also saw meta lose 70%, tesla lost 70%, Netflix lost 70%, and BITCOIN lost 70% (64k to 20k) before stabilizing. 

Sentiment: 59.2%

Neutral Sentiment: 21.7%

Bullish Sentiment: 19.1%

Comment,1jd3yj2,PM_Me_Ur_Clues,1742206797.0,"There are so many variables in the money supply. Interest rates, unknowns like how these tariffs are going to hit which is not entirely unpredictable and sweeping tariffs are well understood to have an ugly effect on GDP and how the tariffs plus these radical shake ups in regulatory agencies are going to affect unemployment, ans the bond market.

Stimulus spending is probably a good idea, but inflation is already in dangerous territory. Frankly, I'm worried about a chain reaction.

I was an econ student about 30 years ago, and even though I never used my education professionally, everything I know about tariffs from what I learned in school says 'use sparingly'.  This is a great big spot of unknown territory, and frankly, I'm worried about basic civic and domestic stability at this point, with all the vitriol being tossed around.  

A lot of the old US Allies in Nato are spooked, too.  The raw data of money action doesn't necessarily reflect the situation on the ground.

Far better economists than I ever was across the spectrum are flashing red lights. This is not something to dismiss out of hand.

Tariffs tax the consumer, and those are going to cause inflation without a doubt.

Comment,1jd3yj2,DifficultyMoney9304,1742211491.0,"Hate to break it to you. But these so called economists have also been calling a recession for the last few years. Talk about cry wolf.

Third money supply growing accompanied with a weaker has always led to higher asset prices. Why is this time any different.

I have waited a really long time because I don't know how to value or benchmark crypto. I can put money into diversified stocks and I don't worry at all because no matter how scary it gets the very long term arc of stocks is up.

Crypto? There isn't that extremely long track record to lean into when it gets scary. But...it seems wrong to have 0% allocation to it. It's got enough track record now to, at least, be sure it's not going anywhere.",1,0,https://i.redd.it/dhelsrzu03pe1.png

Comment,1jcpx5t,Numerous_Ruin_4947,1742170061.0,"Because of negative sentiment. Go on X, Reddit, look at news headlines. It's headlines like ""Will ETH survive"", ""XRP could flip Ethereum"", ""Solana could flip Ethereum"", ""Pectra Testnet Failed"", ""ETH Foundation in Chaos"", ""ETH laundered for BTC"", ""ETH now inflationary with no supply cap"", etc.

People are reading these headlines and saying Ethereum is a fucking train wreck. I have held ETH since 2017, and won't sell and keep staking. But the price of ETH will not wow anyone until these negative headlines and sentiment goes away. This could be a coordinated attempt to crash ETH, for various reasons. It could be an attempt to scoop up ETH at a lower price. Or a more sinister one to destroy Ethereum since it is too decentralized and a threat to Tradfi. There is also a Universe where an entity like BlackRock could try and undermine Ethereum behind the scene (while appearing as a champion), as a gatekeeper for Tradfi. I mean anything is possible when you consider the origin of the Solar System. Hopefully this is not the case. We'll see.",3,0,https://i.redd.it/dhelsrzu03pe1.png

If you are going to hold Alts, you should be rewarded for the higher risk.  It's simple metric of Risk/Reward and Opportunity Cost of not holding BTC.

Historically, every Alt was measured in BTC value because of this Risk/Reward and Opportunity Costt.  When Binance bought Coinmarketcap in 2020, they removed the default Alt BTC ratio on the historical charts which showed every Alt pretty much bled to death against BTC long term.

Synchronicity is an issue l2s are facing because they do not play well with each other. Sometimes it can take 7 days to transfer from one l2 to another. The UX is really poor because it doesn’t feel like one network and it is fragmented. 

Solutions: 

Based Rollups, use the l1 sequencer for transaction ordering so all based Rollups are in sync. Drawback: transaction finality is now tied to the l1 block time which isn’t a great UX. Preconfirmations are being worked on which could bring finality down to 1 second or less.

The l2 superchain, where a bunch of l2s share a single l2 sequencer.

Comment,1jehhrw,ambermage,1742340533.0,"You only need 2 of the 3 to reconstruct. 

Finding or losing 1 isn't enough information to compromise the wallet. 

- X / 0 / X

- X / X / 0

- 0 / X / X

This is how your keys are recorded. 

Then it's just up to you to hide them well enough that you can recover them later.

A nice simple way is to put the words on washers and then put the washers on a bolt with the nut welded and a welded seam along the side. 

This lets you know if the set has been found because the weld will be broken and the words can't be seen unless the welds are broken. 

It is extremely compact and not noticeable unless someone is looking specifically for the keys.

Comment,1jd0u7v,coinfeeds-bot,1742173839.0,"tldr; Haliey Welch, a viral sensation from her 'Hawk Tuah' catchphrase, launched a cryptocurrency called $HAWK in December 2024, which initially soared to a $500M market cap before collapsing by over 90% within 48 hours. Accusations of a 'rug pull' and lawsuits followed, with Welch claiming she was only the token's face. The incident damaged her reputation, led to regulatory scrutiny, and shook the memecoin market. Welch has since focused on animal rescue efforts and limited media appearances, while facing potential legal and financial consequences from the fallout.

The SEC is investigating many other angles, though. She's not out of the woods. The group of large wallets that all cashed out in tune with one another are the smoking guns. There are 5 key entities under investigation, but there are 10 wallets (making up 96% of all the tokens between them). Who specifically owns these wallets? This is the 500 million dollar question.

Comment,1jd0u7v,eurotreker,1742255322.0,"Good point, although a lack of info is just as telling as facts and proof. The timing of her radio silence, for example. Silence reduces liability. And it's likely she was instructed by her legal council, and if true, could only mean they anticipated an SEC investigation straight away. Why stop the money coming in from other sources? Unless there's much more at stake. Any public comments can, and would be used against her. It's a good strategy, but one only used when necessary. So we now know from a legal perspective, it was necessary. 

But here we actually have ALL involved parties going totally dark on the matter, a coordinated legal manoeuvre for damage control which implies serious liability is, or was, in-play. All of them going silent is suspicious. Last month she spoke out for the first time though, but in a controlled environment (no press release or public audience), suggesting this was another strategic move. Ms Welch is not making these decisions on her own, that much can be implied. It does not speak towards her guilt or innocence, however it is clear: in this silence, she is fighting the loudest legal battle of her life.",1,0,https://cryptodealzone.com/haliey-welchs-500m-token-disaster-where-is-the-hawk-tuah-girl-now/

Comment,1jd0u7v,Change21,1742527335.0,"There seems to be some confusion between inherent and structural traits.

Racism is the assumption that racial traits like skin colour make a person inherently more or less intelligent/skilled/valuable etc. 

For example Nazi’s believe that people with light skin and hair are inherently worthy whereas humans without those traits aren’t. That’s racism.

What I described was a social structure where certain groups have accumulated power and privilege and share it based on their traits. For example a rich white man enjoys more power and privilege in society than a rich black woman. A poor white gets better treatment in society than a poor Latino women.

That’s the difference between racism (inherent traits) and describing structural racism which is how racism functions inside social dynamics, like policing, government, banking, education etc

Were you able to figure out the difference?

Trump isn’t a pos because he white, he’s rich and racist and uses his power to reinforce his privilege and the social structures that protect him. That’s what makes him a pos, his behaviour and treatment of others, not his physical traits.

The bank attributes this to the impact of Layer 2 solutions like Coinbase's Base network, which has reduced Ethereum's market capitalization by $50 billion. These solutions may divert revenue from Ethereum's main network. The bank also predicts Ethereum may underperform Bitcoin, with the ETH/BTC ratio declining to 0.015 by 2027. Ethereum's dominance in key areas is decreasing without proactive measures.

Eg. Keeping it simple 4 data points 1-10

1(tether)2,5,7 total 15/4 = 3.75

2,5,7 total 14/3 = 4.66

You created a 0.91 ~25% difference in this scenario. by using a fixed point that is inconsistent with the data type you are trying to collect. Which appears to be a representation of growth.

Idk how you have put this much work into this project and not figured out the flaw in your logic, and even gone to the lengths you have to do mental gymnastics to justify your continued use of flawed data. 

Even more so when the records are immutable. You can legitimately just fix your data with a Google search.

Comment,1jds3sg,pop-1988,1742260795.0,"BCH was a chain fork, inheriting the baggage of Bitcoin's blockchain from 2009 to 2017, as a kind of airdrop, a dishonest launch  
BCH blocks rarely have more than 100 transactions, so the 32MB ""scalability feature"" is pointless  
BCH fees are cheap because blocks are never full, not by design  

LTC was a fair launch, not a chain fork  
LTC inherits all Bitcoin improvements by rebasing from each new Bitcoin release  
LTC recently has become slower and slower to implement new Bitcoin versions, possibly due to some issues in maintaining a reliable developer group  
LTC's Scrypt mining hash was chosen to be ASIC-proof. Bitmain developed a Scrypt ASIC. Now it's mined only using ASICs  
LTC's shorter block interval is a security risk if LTC ever achieves Bitcoin levels of usage
LTC fees are cheap because LTC's price is very low, not by design  

DOGE was a fair launch, not a chain fork  
DOGE was software-forked from LTC in 2013, and has not had any protocol updates  
DOGE's original developers retired and were replaced. The second developer group also quit, and was replaced by new volunteers  
DOGE's shorter block interval is a security risk if DOGE ever achieves Bitcoin levels of usage  

DOGE has a higher market cap than LTC, proving that having limited supply or unlimited supply is not relevant to price

> decentralized

Are they really? Rumors claim that the BCH node network is less than a dozen node operators running a few hundred puppet nodes on AWS. LTC seems to have only a few hundred nodes. DOGE doesn't care if it's decentralized.

>I just personally believe, and market would appear to also have voted, that this clearly is not about p2p and all about storing decentralized mathematical value.

Again likely true. But my view is true too, that the ""market"" has not realized yet, that you can't store value without the p2p functionality. Which is bamboozling because people have been burned time and time again.

You can't ""store value"" it if you can't move it. If you have to move it via custodians it doesn't matter how you store it the custodian has the last say about it and its value.

>This sort of puritanical insistance on taking the whitepaper as some sort of gospel has been a sticking point, not unlike the religious zealots of the world commom to humanity.

From whom? Not from me and not from 90% of the BCH community. I just point out that Satoshi was 99% p2p cash and 1% SoV because BTC narrative and disciples say otherwise engaging in lies and history rewriting. Maybe you mistake us for BSV zealots, then I would agree. They actually pride themselves for the zealotry. But they are history (thank fuck)

> You would make a great priest, rabbi or imam.

😆 Please don't ever try to read people again. You couldn't be further from the truth. Evidence and truth are valuable but the fad of the time seems to be to make up your own reality and be a Karen about it if others show you evidence against it.

Please no more mindless rambling. The point is without p2p no true SoV. Every SoV without p2p is only a SoV of custodians mercy/grace.

🤡 Exactly, but this is what Bitcoin: a p2p cash system actually achieves: __NO counterparty risk!__

>it’s that it has a value as well, is observable, and factored into professional risk management.

Yes and all that goes out the window when you use custodians again. Do you remember what happened to gold/money? You can't have a trustworthy SoV without controlling it. You are just rebuilding the old system if you can't provide self custody and p2p transfer for everyone. I mean, this is mindboggling easy. 

Exchanges are already fractionally reserving their customers. Likely ALL exchanges have less BTC than they show their customers. It's the first thing custodians do, because they can make a TON OF MONEY doing it.

BTC has the throughput for max. the top 1%. If they make a single tx every 100 days no one else will be able to move coins into or out of self-custody. Core aims for $1000 fees per tx. Saylor expects 300k per tx. But it doesn't matter the fees will level out so that 99% or even more won't be able to use it. There will be millionaires unable to buy a tx.

Find the error.

Dangerous thing is the term you are looking at because you are trying to predict the timeline. I think ETH going up is inevitable, but will it take up by the end of this year? Who knows. I bought ETH a few years ago and it went up double, then it crashed below my entry point and I had to wait another year to be up 100%. So I'd probably recommend not setting up a fixed term but rather setting a fixed gain. If you are after a 50% gain and that just so happens to manifest in the next 8 months, then take those profits and don't chase the peak. In this volatile market, people lose perspective, 50% gain in the short term is A LOT. For 18k you could buy like 90k Algo and run a node which would produce around 300$ a month in Algo tokens.

Comment,1jd8l9e,coinfeeds-bot,1742203809.0,"tldr; A new bill proposed by Luiz Philippe de Orleans e Bragança in Brazil's National Congress seeks to legalize partial salary payments in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The bill requires mutual agreement between employers and employees, mandates at least 50% of wages to be paid in Brazil's national currency, and ensures transparency through official exchange rates. Employers must provide detailed payment statements and financial education. Full crypto payments are restricted, except for freelancers and expatriates, with oversight by regulatory bodies to prevent fraud.

3)tether is USD without rules and regulations sort of old style Swiss bank

\-Bitcoin is close to dead

\-The bull run hasn't even really started

If you look at the condition of the world, adoption and legal changes everything is bullish for bitcoin so it doesn't really make sense that bitcoin is suddenly dying off.

Comment,1jcsld7,marcafe,1742151940.0,"In my view, a bull run isn't just a pump upwards section of the chart. Bullrun is tied to growth but also has phases, it will have ups and downs. The reason why I don't think it is over has two parts; one is that we have seen many tech upgrades and adoption increases on many blockchains and a very solid increase in institutional involvement but the price appreciation isn't reflecting it, it is more about the hype. Second is the political angle where we see a positive vector towards regulation, and this is directly fueling the pump but also is fueling investments into developments. What we've seen is a pure speculative pump in my opinion, for those who want to just make money quickly, but we are yet to see that solid price appreciation that would come from serious long-term investors on the institutional level where holding amounts of tokens will build a foundation in future operations. I think what everyone is waiting for is Real World Assets on blockchain. People are waiting for the moment when stocks, bonds, real estate, tickets, and even IDs are all tokenized. Most people and institutions are still not strong enough to build momentum. So I suppose the answer to your question would be that the bull run is not over because the momentum seems to be coming from the anticipation of something else. And this is rooted in the political and regulatory angle of the whole story. We'll see... it may deflate actually and then pump even more if something expected or unexpected happens, like major adoption, like international trading done on RLUSD or something similar.",8,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jcsld7/can_someone_explain_to_me_why_this_bullrun_has/

However, I'll put in my 2 cents and say that the bull run is finished. It ended in January when BTC made that double top. A double top is very...very...bearish. Like extremely extremely extremely bearish.

I expect BTC to fold back into the mid 40k or low 50k area before coming back up. I'd say the market is pretty much done.

As I said, IDKSAF. So take what I say with a grain of salt. For all I know this could be just a huge bear trap. It has happened before. It happened in mid 2021.

Comment,1jcsld7,fukidiots,1742170194.0,"There's never been a bull run that ended in less than 12 months from the halving date. And three of the four were closer to 18 months.

But definitely ignore anyone claiming to know how high or low any alts will go. That's just bullshit. 

The Bitcoin cycle is based on BTCs design, its decentralization, and its widespread adoption. Alts only have an alt season generally based on the Bitcoin bull run in its cycle. People believe that speculators sell out of Bitcoin and then pump alts, so the alt season usually lags the Bitcoin bull run by weeks and is super unpredictable.",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jcsld7/can_someone_explain_to_me_why_this_bullrun_has/

Comment,1jcsld7,ShillBandit,1742204937.0,"no one knows anything

  
but here's the rational for a bull

there are ""hidden rules"" in crypto for several cycles now that indicate a top. These have not really happened

(dominance dumping, alts running, eth doing final run)

Now you can say: this time is different

  
Here's the problem with that. If you go with that route, then bitcoin did a 30% pump off ATH, not a single alt except 5-6 got any good returns except losses.  
VC funding has been halted because of no returns, only joke coins like meme coins did good, but let's face it, nowhere near as good as 2021.

so returns have been garbage for speculators and crypto is let's be honest here just speculation

it means the complete END of the market

Seeing institutions interested and a lot of otc bids, it makes me think they don't want this over yet.

No one can give you anything more than a guess. 

I sold 90% of my portfolio a few days after Trump was elected. Not because I thought the bull run peaked, but because I thought the uncertainty of Trump in office would have a larger negative impact on the market than any other bull case for it.

How long? 

Which investors? 

How are you measuring optimism? 

Let's break it down...

1) prices have stopped rising.  Jan and Feb were flat.  March has seen drops.  Is this really meeting the definition?  

2) there is definitely a change in optimism. Perhaps it depends on your view of trump?  But around the world he is seen as a destructive figure of fun. Except the repercussions are anything but fun.  His association with crypto could permanently damage the brand. 

So it's not rising, and people are less optimistic. 

Yeah, I'd say it is over.

Set chart to weekly candles.


Draw a line on the two most recent tops and extend it from cycle bottom to peak (left to right).


Copy that line.


Drag it down to make it line up with two most recent cycle bottoms.


That's your channel.

I personally see alts going 10-100x from here. However, the this cycle is different narrative has a different spin this time.

The amount of institutional money entering mostly BTC is unique. BTCay not bleed from those investors and hedge funds into alts as much as previous cycles, or at least the ATH to trough bear bottom won't be as extreme. I see a 50% of less retraction of BTC from peak to trough this next bear cycle.

That would be the sorriest Altcoin Season in the Earth's history. I don't believe it's true. Nothing except for shill projects with exorbitant amounts of supply and maybe 6 memecoins sustained anything past a 250% increase from the current prices. That lasted 5 weeks, then everything crashed again. That, to me, isn't good enough. That's not an Altcoin Season.

I'd argue it's pointless even playing the game. 

Given most are in profit, it's a great time to exit.  Take that profit. Label yourself a winner. Never play again. 

I'm only here because I got lucky in 2014.  I'm happy to sell my tax free allowance each year to y'all.  It's a free holiday yeah holiday for life.  Or until the whole thing collapses lol

People who trade are spending a lot of money on fees and barely keeping up with everyone who just holds.  I bet many are actually down. And I bet few have good accounting, they probably done even understand if they are beating the market.  

Just holding is also pointless.  You're  putting all your money into the system each month.  All your hard earned money.  With no guarantee you'll ever get any back.  No one is planning to sell. 

Both approaches just seem weird.

But look at November 9, 2021 when we were at the tippity top of the last cycle.  The majority of people were still telling themselves that the market meltup still hadn't started and there was going to be a huge Alt Season at the end of 2021 to January 2022 just like end of 2017 to January 2018.


> |    | Nov. 9, 2021    |

> | BTC        |          $67,000|       
> | ETH        |          $4,700|      

> - We haven't seen the real euphoria phase of this bull run yet.

> - Look at the 2014 bull run..then 2017... we haven't seen the real ride yet. The real 'blow-off top' I personally will get excited when I see vertical walls of green, walls that you need freaking climbing gear to get on top of those walls.

> - Bullruns end in euphoria I agree 100%.

> - I am totally agree with you. I think we are starting.  Get ready 

> - Agreed. Every other bull run had weeks of crazy +30% kind of days and it felt like every day you didn’t throw in your life savings was throwing away free money. This has just been a fairly steady climb up in comparison.

> - Great post! I always enjoy seeing these historical charts and comparing previous bull runs. I first got into crypto during the 2017 bull run, so it’s neat to see how things look this time around vs back then

> - Tell me when we reach the peak so I can buy high and sell low.


> - *""However, we are clearly already there...""* I don’t feel my legs tremble yet, trust me when btc hits 100k shit is gonna get wild.  We haven’t seen nothing yet.

> - Couldn't agree with you more. I feel the current 200k predictions are really a minimum of where we will get to

> - Rlly curious if it's coming. Hopefully yes. Diamond hands!

> - Thank you for posting this. I’m not selling!!

> - Worth noting that while previous runs are always used as indicators. This isn’t set in stone and it’s possibly dangerous to lead people to believe that these past indicators are a definite sign of what is coming. Unpopular opinion: I would expect a downturn by EOY.

> - Maybe this bullrun's version of euphoria is everyone saying ""We haven't hit euphoria yet so we have a long way to go."" There is a euphoria in believing the cycle is still early forever.

109K + 16.1K = 125K is next ATH

So in 4 years we have an ATH increase to 125K to look forward to. If you bought the top of this cycle at 109K you have a 13% increase to look forward to over 4 years. That will drive considerably less excitement.

I guess if you can pick out the bottom you can still get a 2 or 3X on it, but that's only cool for traders not long term holders.",3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jcsld7/can_someone_explain_to_me_why_this_bullrun_has/

Comment,1jdljm4,fu_paddy,1742245672.0,">and why does a paid version of the app exist

It doesn't. Kraken Pro is just Kraken with more of it's web UI features. It's free.

I don't know what to tell you - they seem to have the least bad rep. I've been using them with no problem, they've been around for a while and there have been no accidents.

I feel *relatively* safe leaving my crypto on their platform. What does this mean? It means that I feel like when the market crashes again, they won't orchestrate an exit scam and fuck off with my money. The CEO appears to be solid, hasn't been in jail(looking at Binance here), hasn't been involved with any scams(as far as we know), hasn't launched a rugpull with his dog(something the former Binance CEO did but denied doing). He sometimes reminds people ""Not your keys, not your coins"" which is pretty based.

Lately, however, they've been putting all sorts of shitters on the platform, with Jailstool being the biggest in the pile. Jailstool is a rugpull, proudly presented as such by Dave Portnoy - a person who has been openly bragging about making millions by using his followers as exit liquidity. Not only did Kraken launch his scam token on their platform, they're partnered with him, they retweeted some of his livestreams exposing their clients to his exit liquidity scams. The first time I ever heard of this vile, disgusting human being was when Kraken retweeted his livestream and it came right into my notifications.

Now, this pales in comparison with the allegations and conspiracies (I believe them to be 100% true) made against Binance. Then another alternative is Coinbase, but once you start reading all the stories about them you realize they're, if not worse than Binance, at least as bad.

At the end, I think I have high faith in Kraken. Maybe too high. On a more positive note - they've been making some solid improvements on their trading platform. They've also been partnering with solid people and retweeting generally good and educational content. I've needed support like 2 or 3 times, every time support got in touch within 5 minutes, helped clear out any questions or issues I had. Very polite, very professional. You can reach them instantly here, on X(twitter) or from the app.",6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jdljm4/kraken_vs_binance_as_an_exchange_noob_here/

There is no paid Kraken app tho? Kraken Pro is just a more sophisticated free app with more options for placing orders, but not a paid app.

Binance is not active in my region so never used it.

Comment,1jdljm4,No-Magician-2257,1742301087.0,"The price of crypto is not fixed but changes every microsecond. What regular kraken does is freeze the price for a longer duration so it gives you time to complete the transaction on a semi-static price. While the price is frozen, especially during high volatility, kraken might need to deliver crypto at a higher price than what the customer paid and vice versa. This is spread risk. To compensate for possible losses here, they add a spread to the fee.

In worse case scenario, you click buy on Kraken and when they try to take it off the market, someone depleted the entire order book and they must pay an almost infinitely high price to deliver the contract.",3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jdljm4/kraken_vs_binance_as_an_exchange_noob_here/

Offramp is Shakepay because I reside in Canada. 


So I'm currently georestricted to only buying ""new block"" BTC/ETH, so there's a lot of fees along the way to convert to other alts. 


My last transaction I bought DOT dollar for dollar with BTC, sent directly from my onramp to my on-network wallet address, pre-converted. As soon as confirmations cleared I had the deposit immediately. (easily avoided at least another 5-10% lost in fees from all the transactions necessary for conversion) 


I usually use walletless transactions, deposit to an auto-generated address that does the conversion automatically. Luckily got out Solana before the crash thanks to RocketX without having to send anything to a centralized exchange.

Comment,1jcntbe,coinfeeds-bot,1742139006.0,"tldr; A Bitcoin whale has placed a $368 million leveraged short position on Bitcoin (BTC) with 40x leverage, betting on a price decline ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on March 19. The position, opened at $84,043, faces liquidation if BTC surpasses $85,592. The move comes amid macroeconomic uncertainty and key economic reports that could impact risk assets like Bitcoin. Analysts suggest Bitcoin needs a weekly close above $81,000 to avoid downside volatility, with markets largely expecting the Fed to hold interest rates steady.

Comment,1jcntbe,MadUnit,1742142152.0,"The $382M Bitcoin Short: A Whale’s Gambit We Can Turn Into Their Nightmare

Alright, ladies and gentlemen, let’s break this down. We’ve got a situation brewing in Bitcoin that’s got my spidey senses tingling—think GameStop vibes, but with a crypto twist. There’s this whale out there, wallet “0xf3f496c9486be5924a93d67e98298733bb47057c,” who’s gone and dropped a $382 million short on BTC at $84,040.80. Originally $332 million, they tacked on another $50 million like it’s pocket change. They’re running 40x leverage on Hyperliquid, and their liquidation line’s sitting pretty at $85,297. That’s the setup—now let’s talk why this matters and how we can flip the script.

First off, I’m not here to shill or hype—I’m here to analyze. This whale’s betting big that Bitcoin’s headed for a fall. They’ve got skin in the game, sure—about $9.5 million in collateral—but that 40x leverage means they’re walking a tightrope. BTC’s at $84,294-ish right now, so they’re already sweating a bit, down maybe $1 million or so. One post even claimed they’re up $1.1 million, but that’d need a price dip below entry, and I ain’t seeing it yet. Point is, they’re exposed. Vulnerable. And that’s where we come in.

Rewind to GameStop: shorts got greedy, overextended, and we—the retail crowd—saw the play. We bought, we held, we squeezed ‘em ‘til they cried uncle. This BTC short? It’s not 140% of the float like GME was, no—it’s a measly 0.023% of Bitcoin’s 19.6 million supply. But hear me out: it doesn’t need to be. That $85,297 liquidation’s only 1.2% away. A tiny nudge in crypto terms. If we coordinate—HODLers, traders, even the silent majority—we could push BTC over that line. Their position goes poof, they eat a $15-20 million loss, and we chalk up a win.

Now, let’s zoom out. Bitcoin’s market cap is $1.65 trillion, daily volume’s $20-30 billion. This $382 million short ain’t moving the needle alone—it’s a drop in the ocean. But on Hyperliquid, where this trade lives, a liquidation could spark a chain reaction. Other shorts get jittery, prices spike locally, and maybe it bleeds into spot markets. It’s not about tanking the whale’s whole operation—it’s about making ‘em pay. And more importantly, making ‘em scared.

See, if we pull this off, it’s a message. Whales who try to manipulate BTC with these monster shorts will hesitate next time. They’ll remember the retail army that turned their gamble into a cautionary tale. This isn’t just a trade—it’s a stand. A chance to show the suits, the big shots, that the little guy’s got teeth. I’m not saying it’s easy—coordination’s tough, and BTC’s liquidity’s a beast—but the math checks out. The opportunity’s there.

So, folks, what’s the move? We sit back and let this whale flex, or we rally, push BTC past $85,297, and watch the fireworks? I like tendies as much as the next guy, and this smells like a chance to serve some up. No financial advice—just the facts and a spark. You decide. Cheers. 🚀",39,0,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-whale-bets-368-m-40x-leverage-btc-decline-fomc?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Security would be a big focus on this if I get the itch to make it happen.

What are your thoughts on Coinbase's Fast Connection option compared to API keys? From how I understand it at a high level, if uses your Coinbase account as the authorization method to trade instead of API keys.

Also, a lot of exchanges offer whitelisting of IP address so this to me would be another additional security measure.

I'm big into security as far as using every method I can to secure any online account I use but that's only as good as the provider of the service as well.

Comment,1jduoyo,ColonelKlink87,1742266248.0,"Valid points as far as CEXs. Fees are the way they make their money.

The way I look at a rebalancing bot is that I prefer it to check for a rebalancing opportunity on a schedule (whether that's hourly, daily, etc) and then only rebalance if at least one coin meet a certain percentage deviation. This to me me allows flexibility with how often you want the bot to rebalance potentially.

Again, I'm more long term for trading so a something like a 5% deviation for me would be ideal at a minimum but I could also see the case for lower percentage deviations with a mix of coins that are more volatile if I wanted them to rebalancing more often.

My goal would essentially be to build a community around such a service. To me there's a lot of complexity with crypto trading bots in general. I haven't really found anything that's just straight and to the point of here's what you need to get started and doing so without a lot of complex functionality and menus. I think there's potentially a smart way to grow something like this into a more advanced offering without turning users away from the shear complexity and price.

Trading bot are generally hard to sell users on when they do not immediately see profits within a shorter time period (at least that's my experience from what I've seen). But with a rebalancing bot, it's more of a long term game and I think a lower priced service could be a win for everyone.

Comment,1jdfmwd,Numerous_Wonders81,1742233691.0,"Goldman Sachs also promoted mortgage-backed securities before 2008—should we trust their timing on gold?

Central banks hoard gold because they run the fiat system. That doesn’t mean gold is the future—just that banks need collateral for their debt printing.""

Gold’s price rising due to central bank hoarding doesn’t mean it’s useful—just that institutions are scared of their own policies.

Central Banks Buying Gold ≠ Fundamental Strength

Central banks buy gold as a hedge against their own monetary mismanagement—it doesn’t mean gold is suddenly more useful or productive.
Historically, central banks have been wrong before—they were net sellers of gold in the 1990s and early 2000s, right before its price surged.
The same banks also ignored Bitcoin ETFs before approval—institutional sentiment changes don’t dictate long-term value.

Short-Term Price Swings ≠ Long-Term Store of Value

Bitcoin and gold move in cycles—Bitcoin’s 14.5% drop is normal market volatility, while gold’s rise is driven by temporary economic fears.
The gold-to-Bitcoin ratio doesn’t measure long-term utility—it just reflects trader sentiment in a risk-off environment.
Bitcoin has outperformed gold by magnitudes over the last decade—focusing on a single month’s dip is cherry-picking.

Gold’s Price Being Driven by Fear Isn’t a Good Thing

If gold is rising due to inflation concerns and trade wars, that’s not a sign of fundamental strength—it just means the financial system is unstable.

Comment,1jcje45,fturla,1742156201.0,"If the bull run is over, then two reasons I see are the cause of an abrupt ending. One of the loss of momentum is lack of liquidity where QE never occurred with the Federal Reserve, and the second reason would be Trump and his unwise decision to literally make war on every top nation by putting tariffs on literally everything then laying off people just because he wants to.

If anyone's interested, Ethereum is on the brink of getting an all time ratio low with Bitcoin at under 2% if BTC jumps to over 90,000 while Eth drops to around 1600. Right now the ratio is about 2.4%  If you want to gamble, then set your limit orders below the 2% level. This ratio hasn't been seen for over 5 years, which may be a bad sign that the trend up for Eth is over and maybe the next level Ethereum might drop to is at 1%.

If Jerome Powell sees that the Fed thinks inflation is a problem before signs of a recession hits, then he will likely keep interest rates the same or higher. He won't drop rates until the indicators imply a severe recession is going to hit. The layoffs by the government are not going to force him to drop rates, because those numbers are manipulated by the administration. He will drop rates when he sees that major companies are reducing prices while firing people at the same time, because that means the demand has dropped and businesses are forced to fire people to remain profitable.

In the crypto space, if BTC drops to around 60k and stays there for more than two months, then the bull run is definitely over. Why? Because all other crypto-currencies will be near or at their all time low ratios to BTC and also likely at or near their dollar value all time low from 2 to 8 years ago. The resistance level at the March 2024 and November 2024 high points will be the major ceiling if any bull run should attempt to run up again.",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jcje45/is_the_bullrun_over_a_historical_risk_analysis/

But if one or several of those do not improve, then we likely continue with a bearish indecision until the markets finally collapse under the weight of uncertainty.",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jcje45/is_the_bullrun_over_a_historical_risk_analysis/

Ppl assuming it’s over are going against many different charts and metrics saying this is just a correction or a normal part of the crypto/liquidity cycle. Comparing to previous cycles, we have had events like the etfs and trump artificially pumping prices early, so naturally to maintain a sustainable price gain, things have to pull back just as much. Which is why ppl are freaking out saying this cycle is different. On a macro scale it isn’t really. We had some roadbumps that sent us up early, but that left a lot of air between us and the ground, so we had to come back down. We are still on route to a new btc ath and alt season, the road just got a lil bumps all by the way and ppl aren’t looking at the big picture",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jcje45/is_the_bullrun_over_a_historical_risk_analysis/

Comment,1jcje45,AlexWasTakenWasTaken,1742126979.0,Well yes it's called dynamic DCA. Or DCA based on risk. For example a dynamic dca strategy started in 2022 until today has 290% profits compared to a regular DCA strategy (200% profits). I just pulled these numbers off alphasquared. It's a no brainer to do dynamic dca instead. For example I haven't purchased at 100k and above because risk was too high for my strategy. Now I've started putting the money I saved during the tops into these corrections. Sure it's a bit more effort but not that much. And I don't know any other strategy that actually works better than DCA except for this.,50,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jcje45/is_the_bullrun_over_a_historical_risk_analysis/

Comment,1jcje45,Kavinsky303,1742162820.0,"You are confusing risk metrics with the question „can Bitcoin climb during QT / no-QE / recession?“. 

Short answer to that question is: yes it can. However, that doesn’t mean that those risk metrics will still tell you accurately when you’re buying at high risk or low risk, i.e. when a top or bottom is near. 

In a nutshell they are all extrapolations of some averaged long-term data from the past 15 years. If the macro environment completely changes though, then that data becomes relatively useless.

If a fully blown-out recession is around the corner, the current risk could be much higher and a top could be much closer (or is already behind us? 109k) than the risk metrics are telling you.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jcje45/is_the_bullrun_over_a_historical_risk_analysis/

Comment,1jdhaom,Zarigis,1742241308.0,"Generally you don't import a ""private key"" into a wallet, you use a recovery phrase (i.e. 12 or 24 words). From this recovery phrase you can generate as many private keys as you like, each corresponds to specific address for a specific chain.


You can use the same recovery phrase to generate an Ethereum private key/public address and a Bitcoin key/address. The only caveat is that it may be possible for someone to deduce that those two public addresses are controlled by the same key.


Different coins may or may not have different ways of deriving a private key from a recovery phrase, but it doesn't really matter. You enter one recovery phrase and the wallet generates a key and public address for any coin/chain, and that address is effectively controlled/owned by that recovery phrase.


You can import that recovery phrase into as many wallets as you like, but keep in mind that each wallet you give your phrase to has complete control over all the addresses/coins that the phrase controls. This potentially adds some security risk.


For hardware wallets it's exactly the same. You enter your recovery phrase and you can now derive any number of public addresses for any coin that the wallet supports. However the actual phrase is stored on the device and (usually) never leaves the device once entered.


In all cases you should always keep a backup of your recovery phrase somewhere offline and secure, ideally on a physical piece of paper or similar. Storing the phrase digitally (e.g. using LastPass) is considered bad practice because it adds the possibility of your phrase being compromised if that service is compromised.


Additionally, although it's possible to use the same recovery phrase on a hot wallet (e.g. exodus) and a hardware wallet, it's considered bad practice. If the hot wallet is compromised somehow, then the hardware wallet doesn't do any good. If the attacker has the recovery phrase they can steal all of the funds controlled by it.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jdhaom/i_had_a_few_unique_questions_on_wallets_what_do/

Comment,1jdp4mn,SomeYak5426,1742249819.0,"Doing a test run of a recovery process is generally not a bad idea, it makes sense that you’d rather find out there’s some issue before you need to do it for real and then it doesn’t work for some reason.

Having tools for it makes sense as you don’t necessarily know other people’s use cases, and if they don’t provide this, then it creates a feature gap that malicious actors can then exploit. So tell people about how bad it is if you can’t recover, use this tool to check your seed phrase and then steal it.

You may be running it on your main computer, but someone else may have it running on an offline and secure computer. You also don’t have to do it ditch your actual live wallet. 

You can simply test the process with a dummy one. 

So create a dummy wallet and then you can test everything works end to end, and then when you’re happy with it, remove the dummy one and create a new one in a more secure way.

Having said all this, I’m not familiar with the phrase you’re using, “seed control”, which raises red flags.

There are probably malware versions of various tools that intercept seed phrases, or you could deploy a keylogger if someone was entering their seed phrase. AI tools make it easier to spot seed phrases from keylogger streams by looking for a pause, then 24 words that are English but not a sentence, and all of a known set, followed by a pause. Then it may be a seed phrase. So attacks like this are more common now as the barriers to carrying them out are lower.",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jdp4mn/trezor_seed_backup_control_is_it_safe/

Comment,1jcjiwi,coinfeeds-bot,1742125806.0,"tldr; David Sacks and his firm sold over $200 million in cryptocurrency and related stocks before his appointment as the White House AI and crypto czar, as confirmed by the White House. This included stakes in firms like Coinbase and Robinhood, and interests in crypto-focused ventures. The divestment aimed to reduce conflicts of interest. Sacks' role involves shaping a legal framework for cryptocurrency. The move comes amid a volatile crypto market and legislative efforts to establish a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve.

What projects are great for what… like if I wanted to publish project plan sets that are resellable, for example.  Or issue certificates of authenticity.",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jd9wwn/im_building_a_comprehensive_database_of_tokenized/
Comment,1jd9wwn,HvRv,1742216915.0,"The fundamental issue with most Real-World Asset (RWA) statistics is that they still operate within the conventional blockchain paradigm of value representation.

What does this mean?
Essentially, the focus remains on tokenizing an asset, with the assumption that the resulting token inherently represents value. In the vast majority of cases (roughly 90%), what’s being tokenized is simply money.

However, these tokenized values are often heavily manipulated, inflated, and ultimately detached from any meaningful real-world utility. They primarily exist within financial speculation rather than practical application.

Tokenized precious metals, for example, are an interesting use case. But many other RWAs are not reflected in Total Value Locked (TVL) metrics because they do not store value on-chain. Instead, the blockchain serves as a mechanism for transferring value between an asset and an individual, rather than as a repository of that value itself.

Sectors such as electricity, ticketing, networking, data, publishing, and agriculture are all leveraging blockchain technology to enhance efficiency, expand markets, and modernize their industries. Yet, their impact isn't captured in TVL statistics, despite being used by millions worldwide.

This raises an important question: What truly constitutes a ""real"" asset in the context of blockchain? The conversation needs to shift beyond inflated market caps and speculative tokens toward actual blockchain-integrated assets and services that provide tangible, real-world utility rather than merely existing as a tokenized representation of something with no real adoption.",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jd9wwn/im_building_a_comprehensive_database_of_tokenized/

Which means, locking part of the supply does not prevent anything, on the contrary. It lures you with a false sense of safety. When, in reality, it is a big flashing sign that spells ""THIS TOKEN'S VALUE IS GOING TO BE DILUTED OVER TIME, LIKE WHEN GOVERNMENTS GO <<MONEY PRINTER GO BRRR>> TO LATER GIVE THAT MONEY TO A PRIVATE PARTY BUUUUT, WITHOUT ALL THE CIRCUS AND MIDDLEMEN""

>Maybe gradual unlocks instead of cliff vesting

Same stuff.

>Better ways to spot the sketchy projects before they blow up

How? There's no way of telling except in hindsight.

>Something that makes on-chain data actually make sense to normal people

I mean, it always does, they just need to learn how that crypto (be it a blockchain or a graph) works. Like, I can't make sense of letters if I don't know how to read.

TL;DR: You can't, only they who control the supply can. Memecoins just be like that. 

So, seriously, mint your own token, and manage it the way you feel it's the most legit one. Being the dev is the ONLY way to 100% prevent a rugpull from a dev. Anything else (even sniping) is just gambling you'll be able to pull before most of the rest of the gamblers.  
You can even try finding a token with a fun and friendly community, getting a nice chunk of the supply, and keep building upon that community. But, the possibility of bigger and earlier investors rugging you won't go away unless you become the bigger and earlier investor. (Could happen, burning tokens is a thing).

Remember ETH is a Leveraged Casino Coin.  

One of the things people seem to be missing is how much of a leveraged casino coin ETH was that drove this rise. Before the bullrun started in 2020, ETH was sitting at a relatively small ~$30 Billion marketcap. DAI was also sitting with $250 Million minted.

BTC started running in Q3 and by peak of the run, ETH was used locked as the native asset to mint $6.2 Billion in DAI. That $6.2 Billion is a massive injection of money into $30 Billion marketcap with an undertoe of a parabolic BTC bullrun and bullish sentiment.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jczk5k/daily_crypto_discussion_march_17_2025_gmt0/

Comment,1jczk5k,biba8163,1742232256.0,"> I like its focus on DeFi and its been steadily growing in app revenue and TVL. Feels promising for a coin that isnt even top 50 right now. Willing to hear counterarguments

DeFi is a bullshit scam narrative promoted by ETH Maxis during the Summer of 2020.  DeFi is ScamFi:

- Essentially a Shitcoin Casino.  Leveraged plays, trading shitcoin tokens, earning yield on shitcoin tokens, providing liquidity on shitcoin tokens

- Nothing Decentralized about it.  Every player like, MakerDAO, AAVE, LINK etc, is centralized

- It's not Finance.  There are NO real life financial products like life, home, health insurance, mortgages, home equity loans, car loans, personal loans without massive collateral, commercial loans, etc.

- Then you slap some scamified metrics like TVL and make it seem like it's a bustling ""ecosystem"" with a lot of finance going on.

> its been steadily growing in app revenue and TVL

As stated, TVL is a scam shitcoin casino metric.  Sonic a shitcoin with a $1.5 Billion marketcap.  How much revenue does it generate? It will be funny.  

For example, mETH heads will argue to death of ETH fundamentals based on its fee revenue and low supply inflation as ultra-sound money making it undervalued.    

Using mETH Head Metrics, TRON is 5% of the marketcap of ETH and collects close to the same amount of fees as ETH and actually has a deflationary supply.  Using valuation is based on mETH head metrics, it would mean TRON is 10X more undervalued then ETH.

| Metric   | ETH    | TRON    |
|:-----------|------------:|:------------:|
| Marketcap        |          $230 Billion|     $20 Billion     
| Yearly Fees      |         $2.48 Billion|  $2.15 Billion
| Supply Inflation  |        0.72%         | -2.5%

Using metrics such as Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio in traditional finance to evaluate the value of companies, it would mean ETH has a PE of something like 110.  The S&P 500  has a PE of like 25 is considered historically overvalued.

> You've probably seen many ETH price predictions usually ranging from $10,000 to $20,000...but  it would thus be erroneous to use BTC price predictions and apply them to ETH as it is almost always done with ETH price predictions. EIP-1559 and PoS will account for a reduction in ~90% in sell pressure due to the deflationary tokenomics and huge monetary incentive to stake ETH which in turn gives more illiquidity, implies the price of ETH could reach up to $150,000 in a best case scenario.

Comment,1jczk5k,biba8163,1742232748.0,"> Hell even 0.05 would be fine

If you're in crypto long enough, you know what happens to Alt/BTC ratio.  NOOBs and mETH Heads are learning and will continue to learn painful lessons.

> If you think 0.04 BTC is low, the ETH/BTC ratio is going to feel like getting kicked in the nuts over and over again over the long term as the ratio falls below 0.01 and goes lower and lower.

> Long term ALL Alts follow the same trend and fall below the initial BTC value they started at.  Pretty much all the older Alts, even the most successful fall below this value.   ETH is also trending long term to fall below this value. People talk about historic trends, patterns and cycles but this has been the only 1 undisputed and unbroken pattern for 14 years.

Warned people that it was a perfect storm situation that rocketed Raiblocks/Nano in 2017/18 and not to expect it again...

> I really think Dec-Jan as the perfect storm for Nano/Raiblocks. Bitcoin had reached the peak of the bullrun and was starting to dump and people were chasing profits in every shitcoin out there with money they had just 15-20X. Also, there was constant press and news about Bitcoin high fees and slow transaction times. Suddenly you have a crypto that has zero fees and is instant. People buy it and the price only goes up because there is zero liquidity due it only being available on 2 shitty exchanges. Lack of liquidity hurts when you dump but can pump the hell out of price when there is demand.....I don't know if/when it'll take off again. But to hold a large percentage of your portfolio hoping this will suddenly boom like it did in the perfect storm scenario is foolish.

Comment,1jcghib,coinfeeds-bot,1742112610.0,"tldr; Donald Trump’s crypto investment firm, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), has incurred significant losses, with its Ethereum holdings alone down $88 million. WLFI had purchased 67,880 ETH at an average price of $3,240 per token, but with Ethereum now around $2,000, the holdings are worth $132 million. The firm’s total portfolio has shrunk from $336 million to $226 million, reflecting a $110 million loss. Despite this, WLFI continues to invest in cryptocurrencies and has partnered with blockchain project Sui to explore new opportunities.

Comment,1jd4k2o,VoDoka,1742201040.0,"Well, the basic truth is, that crypto people call themselves ""investors"" for no reason. Calling yourself an investor in a project for holding a token is like calling yourself an investor in an oil company for filling the tank of your car.

Token are no ownership of the tech or the company. There is a very vague promise that adoption would drive the demand for a token providing some sort of utility (that is, granting the usage of the underlying blockchain ""platform"").

However, currently just about every token is a low-key meme token. People just buy what gets mentioned in the expectation others will buy too. This has driven prices already to a point where I find it hard to imagine a scenario where that valuation could ever be justified by actual future usage.",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jd4k2o/does_the_use_of_a_companys_tech_systems/

People don’t understand that institutions hoarding btc ≠ centralization. The fed = centralization. Centralization of the printing mechanism itself. Btc still has tens to hundreds of thousands of individual decentralized actors mining btc, who then sell it to the people who hoard it at market price.


Also realistically, 2.3% of total supply is peanuts compared to how much of the total supply of USD is held and controlled by a handful of individuals, corporations, and the whim of the fed.

So, along with the top seat, he does control a lot. He also said he had 20,000 coins personally in 2021. I would not be surprised to learn he has doubled or even tenfolded that last 4 years.

Do you not know what inflation is? There is no devaluation as related to fiat, bitcoin is an asset which costs money more money every year when fiat gets inflated, bitcoin is deflationary, you are convoluting it thinking bitcoin has anything to do with cash that way.

Bitcoin has never been ""dependant"" on the larger market, ever, you literally have no idea what you are talking about. The fact that snp100 companies are now required to hold a % of their portfolio in bitcoin related stocks means that its capitulating to require bitcoin, so you literally have it backwards.

The markets are correlated, not dependant, and like anything as it grows they break free when they are worth enough, bitcoin is less tied to tech now more than ever as it becomes a reserve in most states, buisnesses, countries and etc.

Bitcoin fell 1.8% to $82,700, and Ethereum dropped 2.5% to $1,889. Futures traders expect the Fed to hold rates steady, but concerns over inflation and labor data could delay easing. A hawkish Fed stance may pressure risk assets like crypto, which have mirrored equities. Geopolitical tensions and high leverage in crypto markets add uncertainty, with traders awaiting catalysts like Fed decisions or institutional signals to break the downtrend.

Comment,1jchwdw,biba8163,1742172926.0,">  Chainlink is the furthest thing from being a scam in this entire space

It looks like you are a White Knight Bagholder Defender of the ChainLink Scam since 2021 when LINK was $30-50 and you were saying it was going to provide *""functionality for the cryptocurrency economy"" LOL with ""endless future use cases.""*

This  scam token still doesn't do shit besides shitcoin price feeds that it did in 2021 and dump tokens on gullible baghodlers like you:

> Chainlink is a protocol that provides an underlying functionality for the cryptocurrency economy as a whole

https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/les1h4/why_link_tokens_are_needed_for_the_chainlink/

> Bitcoin brought us blockchain, ETH brought us smart contracts, Chainlink makes those smart contracts useful for more than just tokenization.

https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/msviy2/1_bitcoin_first_generation_2_ethereum_second_gen/guvrxcd/

> Chainlink is the key to creating more useful dApps. Currently, its most prominent use-cases are providing price feeds to decentralized exchanges and providing provable randomness to NFT projects. The possible future use-cases are endless.

https://np.reddit.com/r/Chainlink/comments/posl1q/what_does_chainlink_do/hcyv3ks/

Reminder to noobs that the ChainLink scam and the entire DeFi economy bullshit is a scam.  DeFi is ScamFi:

- Essentially a Shitcoin Casino.  Leveraged plays, trading shitcoin tokens, earning yield on shitcoin tokens, providing liquidity on shitcoin tokens

- Nothing Decentralized about it.  Every player like, MakerDAO, AAVE, LINK etc, is centralized

- It's not Finance.  No real life financial products like life, home, health insurance, mortgages, home equity loans, car loans, personal loans without massive collateral, commercial loans, etc.

- Then you slap some scamified metrics like TVL and make it seem like it's a bustling ""ecosystem"" with a lot of finance going on.

Crypto's has 2 Killer Use cases, otherwise you are mostly getting scammed by bullshit Ethereum meme use cases:

- BTC

- Stablecoins

Only 2 Assets that have grown in Crypto since 2021:

- BTC

- Stablecoins

Excluding BTC/Stablecoins

- The Alt marketcap has shrunk by almost -50%

- The Alt marketcap has shrunk -50% but the total number of coins/tokens has risen from 3,500 to millions

- The shrinking Alt marketcap combined with the explosion of number of Alts have resulted in a massive dilution of liquidity and a effusion of bagholder tears

Halvings by definition are half as impactful as the previous halving. Lowering bitcoin output by 64>32>16>4>2>1 makes for smaller supply shocks over time. Lowering by 1 BTC doesnt hit the same as -32 BTC.

Comment,1jc8d8n,HalcyoNighT,1742089392.0,"It is not an excuse. Apologies for this word vomit but I'll just copy-paste a ChatGPT summary since I wont be more eloquent than that:



The recent downturn in the cryptocurrency market stems from a convergence of political, economic, and investor-related factors—many of which are tied to recent actions from the newly re-elected Trump administration and influential figures like Elon Musk.

# 1. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Sparks Uncertainty

President Donald Trump’s executive order to establish a **Strategic Bitcoin Reserve**, leveraging approximately 200,000 BTC seized through legal proceedings, was positioned as a move to strengthen America’s foothold in the digital asset space. However, this unprecedented level of government involvement in crypto markets has **spooked investors**, raising fears over potential manipulation, market intervention, or sell-offs, all of which have contributed to heightened volatility.

# 2. Escalating Trade Tensions Trigger Risk-Off Sentiment

The administration’s imposition of **25% tariffs** on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China has injected fresh uncertainty into global markets. These trade tensions have fueled a broader **risk-off movement**, where investors are pulling out of speculative assets—cryptocurrencies chief among them—in favor of safer havens.

# 3. Deregulation Raises Oversight Concerns

The Trump administration’s **deregulatory approach to crypto**, including the abrupt dismissal of major SEC lawsuits against leading digital asset companies, has further destabilized investor confidence. While some view deregulation as bullish for innovation, the lack of clear legal frameworks and enforcement mechanisms has sparked concerns over **market integrity and long-term stability**.

# 4. Elon Musk’s Government Role Shakes Market Confidence

Elon Musk’s recent appointment to head the **Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)** has drawn attention away from Tesla and reignited debate over his outsized influence in the crypto space. Since mid-December, **Tesla’s stock has plummeted over 55%**, largely due to investor fears around Musk's split focus. ​Tesla stock doesn't directly affect crypto prices, but it can influence investor sentiment. Musk has historically been a major driver of crypto sentiment, especially for Bitcoin and Dogecoin. For example, when Tesla announced it bought $1.5B worth of Bitcoin in early 2021, it caused a surge in BTC price. Therefore, any plunge in his credibility, focus, or financial stability (as tied to Tesla) will reduce confidence in crypto.",4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jc8d8n/what_happened_to_the_4_year_cycle_the_sp500_is/

Yes, Bitcoin is still relatively small asset in monetary value, and is prone to manipulation. It's happened this year, and actually every year.   
  
But the crashing to $10K is wild. That is highly unlikely. Very unlikely to happen even when the bear market comes (which is not yet).

We have seen the crypto narrative go extreme fear and despair before, only to recover to new ATHs shortly afterwards.

The reason crypto miners are down in Texas is because of the cheap wind power. They were able to make a deal with the local power company where they use up the 'excess' power (from renewables), and help stabilise the grid; in some cases, they can sell their (unused) power back to the grid when consumption is high/renewable generation is low.

Smelting may require a more constant and reliable source than wind, though, so it may not directly compete with Texas BTC miners who can stop or start their mining at the push of a button.

The US also lost $525 million to $1.38 billion in tax revenue. The report underscores broader economic impacts, including corporate tax losses due to crypto businesses operating offshore, such as Tether, which could have contributed $1.6 billion in taxes if US-based.

""It"" is an article written by a crypto blog. I translated it to normal English.

Example, when a crypto blog claims that people were ""deprived"" or ""denied"" from accessing crypto, that actually means they were protected from gambling their money, and when a crypto blog claims that regulations are ""slowing down crypto adoption,"" that actually means regulations are working and preventing crypto scammers from thinking they can recreate old financial scams using crypto.",-1,0,https://cryptopotato.com/geoblocking-has-denied-us-investors-2-6-billion-in-airdrops-since-2020-report/

Comment,1jc0o0t,coinfeeds-bot,1742061009.0,"tldr; Brazil's National Congress has received a bill proposing the legalization of salary payments in Bitcoin and other digital assets. Authored by Luiz Philippe of Orleans-Braganza, the bill seeks to regulate labor payments in virtual assets, allowing employees to receive up to 50% of their wages in cryptocurrency. Employers must provide financial education on market volatility and transaction security. The proposal aims to enhance Brazil's status as a global crypto hub and attract foreign investments while maintaining the utility of the Brazilian real.

What they are going to do to scam you is already setup

>Yes, my funds are all stored in my internal wallet account, not on the Coinbase exchange, because the exchange does not involve this type of derivative trading

When she sells you on investing with her she'll give you a link to ""the place that involves this type of trade.""  This link will let you set up an account, wire money in, and then pretend to play with it.  She will likely show you big profits too, and get you to invest more and more.  Then when you try to withdraw for any reason, suddenly you can't.  The company will say ""You can withdraw but we need this fee, and this fee.""  And the scammer will be there to tell you ""yeah, I pay that all the time, but look at your profits you're up 50%"" or something.  Then you pay the fees, and they ask for more, etc

Its called ""pig butchering.""  Check it out.

Then she will help you set up an account with them and get you to deposit money to that platform.

Comment,1jd4gna,Kat-but-SFW,1742196487.0,"One more thing, if you send money into one of these scams, it is very common for your first withdrawal to work and actually get money back. This is because the a lot of victims will send some money but are too cautious to just dump their life savings in. When the withdrawal works, they think ""I wasn't sure if this was a scam, but they let me withdraw real money, it's actually legit! I really did find a once in a lifetime opportunity, I'm going to go all in!"" So they send way more money back into the scam, *THEN* the trap closes shut.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jd4gna/why_would_you_need_to_wire_money_to_play_binary/

Comment,1jd4gna,Anantasesa,1742196356.0,"Yeah Coinbase wallet is different from the Coinbase exchange. Anyone with your seed phrase can access the contents of your CB wallet and they don't even need to use that brand of wallet. So if you created it then the scammer isn't in control of THAT wallet unless you share the seed phrase. So it's probably a smart contract to link to your wallet so coins like usdt or usdc can be transferred to the ""binary trading wallet"" which is just a regular wallet they own but with software they wrote to make it look like it's growing. That's about all I know. Binary currency options are available on centralized platforms like nadex. So I'd assume crypto binary if they exist would also be centralized where a company has a registered presence, not on a private wallet.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jd4gna/why_would_you_need_to_wire_money_to_play_binary/

Where does it end? If I stake 64 ETH, wrap it as 32 stETH and 32 WETH, then wrap the stETH as 28 wstETH, then make a wstETH-WETH Univ2 token, is the network securing 32 (stETH) + 32 (wstETH) + 32 (WETH) + 64 (wstETH-WETH) = 160 ETH worth of ERC20 tokens?

Rules of the protocol. Same for most PoS. The entire max supply is created, then various mechanisms used to reduce supply over time.  So minting new would require a protocol change which would probably result in a hard fork.

Comment,1jc8re6,qldvaper88,1742088303.0,"Easiest way is to find a 'centralised exchange'. Many of them. You create an account, send real money to the exchange through a debit card transaction or something of the like. Then you can buy the coin of your choice and it will go to the wallet that is included with your centralised exchange account. You can then send that crypto to another wallet of your choosing, generally a hardware wallet like trezor or ledger is advised, because they allow you to have a wallet where the seed phrase is never inputed onto a PC/phone which is paramount for security in this day and age where hackers are rampant.

When you want to sell, send crypto back to the exchange and you can sell it back to them for fiat currency. If you aren't looking at long term investment or large amounts of crypto, a hardware wallet isn't a necessity (in fact it never is). Fwiw, any wallet that isn't a hardware wallet is referred to as a 'hot wallet' .",5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jc8re6/daily_crypto_discussion_march_16_2025_gmt0/

Now, there’s no way to say what will happen in the future, but with a five year time horizon I’d bet (and Saylor is betting) that the aggregate BTC price will hold to that pattern. In that case his holdings only grow. In reality it would take an unprecedented period of stagnation or contraction for him to lose.

Comment,1jc2h1f,PresentationTime3159,1742080522.0,"The money doesn’t come directly from your taxes as a tax payer. I think what trump is tryingggg to do, is use the tariffs as a way to bring in a tax neutral income for the US that doesn’t affect the typical American tax payer, so they can load up the Bitcoin reserve. Similar things were done when the dollar was backed by gold, to load the gold strategic reserve way back when. However after we stopped doing tariffs back then, we unlinked the dollar to gold as well. Which means it has nothing actually backing it. I’m speculating that at some point in the future, 20 years down the line, a bill will be proposed backing the US dollar to Bitcoin similar to how gold was back when, after the strategic reserve is implemented fully. Doing this would make it damn near impossible for the US dollar to not be the dominant currency in the world, as well as eventually bring the volatility in the crypto space to a hold. They are taking the if you can’t beat it join it strategy. It’s just not going to happen over night, and most boomers do not understand crypto. It’s funny my grandfather doesn’t understand that people invest in crypto off belief in the technology, and I’m like well why did you invest in stock market companies and he goes “belief in the company and what they produce” same shit different products and people are scared of it cause it challenges were they hold all there money and they don’t want to abandon ship into the unknown which is risky atm",2,0,https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2025/3/14/a-majority-of-voters-oppose-a-crypto-strategic-reserve

No it wasn’t until the Egyptians claimed gold was worth money, instantly shooting the price into a skyrocket back in ancient times.

Comment,1jbyehn,uncapchad,1742057387.0,"I watched the 4hrs of the hearings. Did have some stress at one point, as the issue of tokens in general and stables was conflated!  I do think by the end the hearing committee did broadly understand the differences.  Whether they understood enough, I am not certain. 

It's an important step and I think pressure to be first (or one of the first) was the general message. Make digital remittances safe, seemed to be the message. 

Whether stable coins become de facto CBDCs remains to be seen. UK's discussion documents seem to also be leaning towards only stables which will be issues by Treasury..... Just something to watch, I guess

I do also wonder if eventually CEXs may end up in a New York situation; where you are free to trade Bitcoin but may only custody/withdraw stables or that withdrawals of Bitcoin etc will only be allowed wrapped, using some permissioned chain.  I know I know, right to self-custardy but if one State can override, there is the potential that right to self-custody comes to mean ""only when Federal govt says it is ok to do so"".

Comment,1jbyehn,HSuke,1742062812.0,"I have a different concern about Bitcoin that's actually really important for the long-term safety of the reserves. This is something that blockchain devs and technical members of the community are really concerned about.

Historically, Bitcoin's security budget has been increasing in magnitude every cycle. But it's been slowing down over many years and is now reversing. **This is the first cycle where Bitcoin's security budget is considerably less than that of 4 years ago (40% less).**

If this trend continues, within a couple of decades, Bitcoin's security will be like a team of unarmed security guards protecting Fort Worth.

Bitcoin has **asymmetric security** based on Nakamoto consensus using heaviest-chain version of Proof of Work. The investors who hold Bitcoin do not control Bitcoin's security. They are at the mercy of miners. The level of protection is based on Bitcoin's security budget. The higher the security budget, the more protection it gets.

It's very weak to 51% attacks when the security budget is low. In fact, unlike with PoS, plenty of PoW blockchains with small security budgets have been 51% attacked before.

It still costs about $10B to attack Bitcoin and many years of manufacturing. Even now, a large country like China could out-manufacture the rest of the world in Antminer S21 ASIC miners over a period of several years and 51% attack Bitcoin. As the security declines over more cycles, it's going to much cheaper and easier to attack Bitcoin.

Are any of the decision makers even aware that it only costs $10B to destroy a $1.5T blockchain, and that it gets cheaper with every cycle? It's really cheap to attack Bitcoin since the attack can be short, but very expensive to keep Bitcoin secure indefinitely. Are politicians prepared to spend tens of billions of dollars annually on Bitcoin mining to keep it secure?

51% Attackers can reorg the chain, double-spend on bridges, censor US transactions, continuously mine empty blocks, cause absolute chaos, prevent exchanges from transferring for days, or mine out all block rewards within 2 months with a time warp attack.",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jbyehn/us_sen_bill_hagerty_momentum_is_clearly_with_us/

Comment,1jbmubz,Born_Acanthisitta395,1742013439.0,"Alright, let’s take this nonsense apart like a comedian ripping into a heckler at a bad comedy club.

First off, Tim Draper saying Bitcoin is going to infinity against the dollar? Yeah, sure, and my gym membership is going to turn me into Chris Hemsworth overnight. This dude has been screaming ”$250K BTC is just the start!” for years, and yet here we are, still waiting. It’s like that guy at a party who swears he’s about to launch the next big startup but still lives in his mom’s basement eating Hot Pockets.

The article breathlessly parrots his claims, acting like Draper is some kind of financial Nostradamus instead of just another rich dude trying to pump his bags. Look, I get it—Bitcoin has potential, but treating it like some unstoppable financial singularity that will obliterate all fiat currencies is just lunacy. The dollar isn’t going anywhere because, spoiler alert, governments exist, and they kinda like having control over their own money. You think the U.S. is just gonna sit back and let Bitcoin turn the Federal Reserve into a Blockbuster Video? C’mon.

And let’s talk about this “Bitcoin will become the global reserve currency” fantasy. Yeah, because the world is totally ready for a currency that fluctuates 10% every time Elon Musk sneezes on Twitter. Oh, I’m sorry, I meant X—you know, because Musk is such a financial genius, just like the people who bought Tesla at $400 and are now crying into their Dogecoin wallets.

Then there’s the classic “Bitcoin is immune to government control” argument. Oh yeah? Ask anyone who’s tried to cash out millions of BTC and run a business in the real world how “immune” they are to regulation. The IRS, SEC, and every three-letter agency with a badge and a budget would like a word. Governments might not be able to shut down Bitcoin itself, but they sure as hell can make it a nightmare to use.

The funniest part? This is the same crap Draper has been saying for years, and he’s still moving the goalposts. First it was “$10K is just the start,” then “$100K BTC any day now,” and now we’re talking about “infinity”? Oh, just infinity? No big deal. What’s next? “One Bitcoin will be worth all the money in the universe, plus an extra McDonald’s Happy Meal?” If Bitcoin actually hits the numbers he’s predicting, we’ll have much bigger problems—like hyperinflation so bad we’ll be using wheelbarrows of dollars just to buy coffee, Weimar Republic style.

At the end of the day, this article is just another hype piece for people who think buying crypto makes them the next Warren Buffett. It’s hopium mixed with financial delusion, topped with a healthy dose of “please buy Bitcoin so my bags go up.” And if you believe it, I’ve got a bridge to sell you—accepting BTC only, of course.",-2,0,https://news.bitcoin.com/tim-draper-bitcoin-goes-to-infinity-against-the-dollar-250k-btc-is-just-the-start/

Comment,1jc1g8f,coinfeeds-bot,1742062807.0,"tldr; Blackrock is advancing the tokenization of real-world assets, notably through its BUIDL token, a stablecoin launched in March 2024 on Ethereum. BUIDL, backed by U.S. Treasuries and Repo contracts, offers institutional investors daily on-chain U.S. dollar yields. It has become the largest tokenized on-chain fund of U.S. Treasuries, capturing a quarter of the $4.2 billion tokenized Treasury market. Blackrock's efforts highlight Wall Street's growing influence in the tokenized asset market, raising concerns about decentralization and financial inclusion.

Comment,1jcky5x,Kerfits,1742332974.0,"The obvious thougth; is mining will increase because it’ll be cheaper, but i’m not certain because of balancing of energy prices.

Fusion energy is after initial cost of construtrion cheaper to produce than nuclear fission due to breaking free of cost of mining heavy radioactive isotopes. This will (maybe) become less cost of crypto mining. I guess that one is in the hands of the energy sector. Energy sources tend to balance out. Crude oil for exmple is having artificial production stops, as is tradition, to decrease supply in a perpetual demand. Owners of fission reactors will probably sell energy cheaper but will probably not go crazy below the price/energy of crude oil. But hey! It’s better for the environment!

AI -might in case of energy being cheaper get a surge of higher quality deep ML and LLM models in less time, making a leap in advncements.

Edit:

The lower demand for heavy radioactive isotopes falling will direct the mining industry to WMD manufacturers, nuclear weapons arsenals will probably increase or renew, taking advantage of the reduced demand/price.

Edit 2:

We might get a political schism of AI vs. crypto. Since the two share the same technology and energy source. An increasingly centralized world will have to choose which side to favor; wealth generation or synthetic awareness.

This might spin off into Dysonian ventures in space to automate the creation of solar panels around the sun driven by AI and using Venus and Mercury as raw materials to build a network of satellites around the sun and directing a laser beam from them to the moon to receive the energy captured, mining crypto and training AI models on the moon with fields of kluster datacenters sharing the energy between the two applications, ruled by left and right wing politics. (Guess which ones they vote for)

3dit:

The worlds future energy production in a Dysonian scenario would be two faced; the human economical aspect of using crypto currencies to fund the venture, and Synthetic awareness AI that will actually venture into space and build the thing.. AI might tilt the politics by psychological manipulation to direct the energy towards AI to favour itself instead of crypto that only favors human economy.",1,0,https://peakd.com/@tokenizedsociety/nuclear-fusion-ai-and-crypto-a4i

Comment,1jcovr0,phincster,1742143238.0,"The decline is directly because of trump’s tariffs.

Trump believes placing tariffs on every country we trade with will bring back jobs and manufacturing.

Trump also likes tariffs as a blunt tool to get what he wants out of other countries. All he has to do is tweet out a threat and it forces governments and companies all over the world to take notice and respond.

Its as simple as that.  

As far as crypto goes, IMO trump simply sees it as another commodity like gold or oil.  We have fort knox, we have a strategic oil reserve…..now he wants a crypto reserve.

Theres no 4d chess going on here.  IMO trump is completely wrong on tariffs.

That's not rich, that's half a year's salary for a middle-income family. And the people who could afford to put in $100,000 or more in 2022 to turn into a million today were either already rich, or monumentally stupid for risking that much of their net worth on a single asset.

On top of that, the next cycle's going to be even more anemic, most people buy close to the top, not the bottom, and contrary to your personal opinion, you are not special.

Blockchain analytics firm Bubblemaps and YouTuber Coffeezilla traced fund transfers to confirm Davis's involvement. WOLF, promoted by WallStreetBets, reached a $40M market cap before collapsing in a suspected 'rug pull.' Investigators revealed Davis controlled 82% of the token's supply and had prepared for the launch months in advance. Legal scrutiny continues as authorities pursue international action against him.

Comment,1jbpcfz,the__itis,1742045975.0,"Custom prompt GPT take:

This document describes BMAX, a new Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) that invests in convertible bonds issued by companies that hold Bitcoin in their corporate treasury. Here’s a breakdown:

What This ETF Does
	•	Focus on Convertible Bonds: Rather than holding Bitcoin directly, BMAX invests in convertible bonds issued by companies that use Bitcoin as a treasury asset (e.g., MicroStrategy (MSTR) and Marathon Digital (MARA)).
	•	Hybrid Investment Approach: Convertible bonds offer a mix of fixed income (bonds) and equity upside (potential stock appreciation if converted). This can provide a more balanced risk-reward profile.
	•	Simplifies Exposure to This Niche Strategy: Instead of investors buying individual convertible bonds, this ETF pools them into a single product.

Why This Matters
	•	Not Direct Bitcoin Exposure: This ETF doesn’t hold Bitcoin but invests in companies whose debt is tied to Bitcoin treasury strategies.
	•	Lower Volatility vs. Holding Bitcoin: Since bonds have a fixed-income component, this ETF might provide a smoother return profile than direct Bitcoin investments.
	•	Equity Upside Potential: If these companies’ stock prices rise (often correlated with Bitcoin prices), the convertible bonds can be converted into equity at a favorable rate.

How It Works
	1.	Invests 80%+ in Convertible Bonds: Bonds from firms like MicroStrategy and Marathon Digital, which actively use Bitcoin as a treasury asset.
	2.	Actively Managed: Unlike passive ETFs that track an index, this ETF adjusts holdings to optimize returns.
	3.	Diversification Across Issuers: Instead of betting on one company’s convertible bonds, it spreads risk across multiple issuers.

Key Risks and Considerations
	•	Indirect Bitcoin Exposure: The fund’s performance depends on how well these companies manage their Bitcoin strategies and debt obligations.
	•	Convertible Bond Risk: If Bitcoin prices drop significantly, these companies’ stocks could decline, affecting the convertible bonds’ value.
	•	Market & Credit Risk: If issuing companies (like MicroStrategy) struggle financially, bond values could decline even if Bitcoin performs well.

Who This is For
	•	Crypto Investors Wanting Lower Volatility: This ETF provides exposure to Bitcoin-related companies with some downside protection.
	•	Fixed-Income Investors Seeking Upside: Instead of traditional bonds, this gives potential equity appreciation tied to Bitcoin-driven companies.
	•	Institutional or Conservative Crypto Allocations: A way to gain Bitcoin-related exposure without directly holding BTC.",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jbpcfz

Comment,1jbpcfz,Tahns,1742037426.0,"Sorry, my last comment was a bit unclear. Direct equity ownership of MSTR stock provides a high-risk, leveraged position on bitcoin, yes, absolutely. My last comment was about the convertible bonds that Strategy has used to make bitcoin purchases (and the topic of this ETF post). 0% interest rate for a small stock ownership at maturity of the bond. That allows institutional investors to have exposure to bitcoin price appreciation. And if the company were to go bankrupt, the bond-holders would be paid out on the liquidated bitcoin while the equity holders get wiped out.

That’s how Strategy provides several different bitcoin-based financial products to appeal to different investors with different risk appetites. That’s not something a bitcoin spot ETF can provide. ",7,0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jbpcfz

Comment,1jc33en,pop-1988,1742131679.0,"> they would be incentivized to spend it rather than just buy and hold ...  its value wouldn't become bloated by speculation

You're in a forum full of ""investors"". Most of them only use exchanges to store their coins (""what's a wallet?""). They rely on speculation for their hopeful profits  

I suggest the deflation/inflation thing isn't a real incentive to hoard vs spend. It's a Bitcoin speculators' argument - the fixed supply is deflationary, therefore the price must go up forever. LTC is deflationary and is worth fewer and fewer BTC every year. DOGE is inflationary and has overtaken LTC. Price markets are speculative, completely irrational. Being deflationary has no genuine price effect  

A new coin could encourage use for spending if it had coin expiry. Use it or lose it. Send expired coins to miners as a mining reward booster. Coin expiry might be a few years, or a few months. You'd get a lot more ""spending flow"" if expiry was as short as 21 days. This would be a clear message

* spend it immediately
* if you receive some, sell it immediately",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jc33en/cryptocurrency_with_automatically_enforced/

Registration of ownership would only work by State control - using a national ID number. Most people would comply. But, you're claiming decentralization, and you're implementing a centralized ownership register  

Bitcoin (and its dozens of copycats) is decentralized in its node network. There has never been any intention for decentralization of coin ownership",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jc33en/cryptocurrency_with_automatically_enforced/

Comment,1jbt7r4,coinfeeds-bot,1742038806.0,"tldr; Gemini organized a record-breaking drone show in Austin, Texas, featuring 1,000 drones forming the Bitcoin logo to celebrate the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The event earned a Guinness World Record for the largest aerial display of a currency symbol. The US government plans to officially recognize Bitcoin as a strategic holding, similar to gold, retaining confiscated BTC in a central reserve account. This marks a shift in policy under Trump, who proposed the reserve and banned Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).

Such dynamics illustrate how in times of hyperinflation, the richest often consolidate their wealth while the majority struggle, raising questions about the intentionality behind economic policies.

Comment,1jbs1sw,anotherfroggyevening,1742050351.0,"Sounds about right. 

Reminds me of:

https://www.cobdencentre.org/2011/02/deep-freeze-iceland’s-economic-collapse/
https://www.cobdencentre.org/2011/05/book-review-deep-freeze-icelands-economic-collapse/
Using the idea of Iceland as their perfect fairy cake experiment, Bagus and Howden tease out every centrally-planned machination designed to manipulate and cajole the world’s productive populations into unknowing governmental fiscal servitude.

As Richard Cantillon noted in his Essay on Economic Theory, enslaved humans usually produce for their masters about half the amount of finished goods that freed slaves produce for themselves. The great trick of the world’s elite may therefore have been to yoke the rest of us into debt slavery, without us realising it, to feed their insatiable greed for power over the rest of us and to extract wealth from the rest of us, thereby avoiding Cantillon’s half-production trap, and thereby avoiding the need for they themselves to be in any way useful to anyone else.

Thus, taxpayers may grumble at the trillions of paper money tickets used to bail out the failed financial entities owned by the elites, but they’ll grudgingly go along with it, so long as they feel that they in some way they control the public ‘servants’ that rule over them, who are of course beholden to these elites via the instruments of public debt employed by our rulers to keep buying power-enhancing votes from the ruled.

Using XRP as a bridge asset, Ripple offers near-instant, low-cost transactions and eliminates the need for pre-funded accounts through its On-Demand Liquidity solution. While Ripple has gained traction with financial institutions, its success depends on regulatory clarity and broader adoption, with ongoing legal challenges potentially nearing resolution.

Almost seems like this scam came from an English speaking country.  What the OP left out of that Screenshot is that it also comes with a recovery phrase that your supposed to import and move your coins too.  Of course the scammer owns this wallet and will immediately empty it after you move your coins into it.    


Also when you try to setup a new Coinbase wallet via recovery phrase Coinbase is thoughtful enough to present a popup that you have to click acknowledge on warning you to never use a recovery phrase given to you by someone else including Coinbase themselves which guarantees this is not legit.  

Not to mention a court would never require something like this to take immediate effect and it makes no sense to begin with since weather an exchange has customer wallets or not has nothing to do with allowing the trade of securities.

To cut the story short, I withdrew my fund but they didn't refund it in full. They charged me amounting to more than 3k.
Last night, someone (foreigner) called me informing me about this 3k, that it is being used by that company, and that they were able to raid such illegal activity of that illegal company. Now, they are trying to return my money and instructed me to download Coinbase wallet. 

It already appears in my coinbased wallet (36,881LUSD). My problem now is that, I can't transfer such amount to my coins.ph account or any other cryptocurrency coz it requires me to at least deposit an amount worth 28k to activate my wallet. He said LUSD is a stable currency (Liquity USD).

The only way you can know that it's not from CoinBase is the from address (which is not shown in a lot of email apps by default) and that the ""Unsubscribe"" is not a link at all.

Good thing that CoinBase Wallet tells you to never put in a recovery phrase unless it's your own - even if it came from CoinBase, but I'm sure a lot of people will fall for it.
