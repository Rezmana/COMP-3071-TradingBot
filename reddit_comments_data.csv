Comment,1jahg0k,meeleen223,1741887297.0,"Great post!

Moons have a perfect self regulatory mechanism removing sell pressure burning more at lower prices.

Comment,1jc8re6,Due-Inspection-5660,1742093600.0,"If you analyse recent comments by US Treasury Sectary Scott Bessent and comments made by Canadian officials after their meeting with the Trump admin in washington last week, you can see that it's very likely Trump wants to agree a deal with ALL COUNTRIES for tariffs to be scaled back, except in a few critical industries like steel and aluminimum.

So I think buying more Bitcoin now and waiting for them to announce a deal over the next few days and weeks is a no-brainer. Once these tariffs get rolled back, Bitcoin is easily going back over 100k almost immediately.

And there are countless other bullish catalysts in play.... it's possible BTC will be over 130k before the end of April.",8,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jc8re6/daily_crypto_discussion_march_16_2025_gmt0/

Comment,1jc5cue,coinfeeds-bot,1742073610.0,"tldr; President Donald Trump announced a 'decisive and powerful' military action against Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi movement, targeting their bases, leaders, and missile defenses. The move aims to protect American assets and restore navigational freedom in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, where Houthi attacks have disrupted shipping and raised costs. Trump criticized the Biden administration's earlier delisting of the Houthis as a terrorist group and warned Iran against supporting them. The strikes mark the most significant military action of Trump's second term.

Once market caps become too large, doubling cant occur anymore.

Etf's and other traditional investments sync up bitcoin investment with standard drip investing. This brings a closer match to the sp500 by average americans just putting their money ""in the market"" over time.

Halvings by definition are half as impactful as the previous halving. Lowering bitcoin output by 64>32>16>4>2>1 makes for smaller supply shocks over time. Lowering by 1 BTC doesnt hit the same as -32 BTC.

Theres also a cap on the amount of humans in the world. Everyone has heard of it, so now potential new holders are limited to legalization, the birth rate and people changing their mind. Its a slower adoption rate than before.

The ultimate lesson is that simple rules don't work for complex systems. Full stop.

Humans love to see patterns, but we're not super great at dealing with complex systems without a lot of effort and training in the particular systems in question.

Comment,1jc8d8n,_Lung,1742088676.0,The pattern is not to double every 4 years how could that be built in. It reached a new ATH that’s what the cycles refer to. The end game for BTC is to have near flat growth (stability). If you’re a BTC maxi & believe all global value will be represented in BTC then at some point the price will only increase as much as global value grows which currently is 3.7% per year,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jc8d8n/what_happened_to_the_4_year_cycle_the_sp500_is/

Did you just come in recently?

In the bear, BTC already broke one of its trend: it fell below its previous cycle's ATH. The ""stock-and-flow"" model had to be squinted so many times to make sense of it.

Comment,1jc8d8n,Life-Duty-965,1742115817.0,"People are very ""good"" at seeing patterns. 

But there is no rule that says these patterns have to hold.

Representative heuristics were useful to our hunter gatherer self's.  If you catch fish at one lake a few times, it's probably worth learning that this lake is a good source of fish.

However this isn't useful for solving complex problems.

At that point we learned that the scientific method was a better way of improving our knowledge.

But when it comes to bitcoin price, all we are doing is looking at patterns and guessing.

Make enough guesses and you'll be right occasionally.  

It's not science though.

We should instinctively know that we don't ""know"" what will happen.

From now on, as the entire crypto market has no other use than to be a store of value, it will become more and more that, like gold.
