Comment,1jahg0k,GabeSter,1741886789.0,"Want to win some Moons funded by the rCryptoCurrency TG? Drop your KrakTag (your Kraken Pay name) **as a response to this pinned comment** and after 48 hours the currently 3,000 Moons raised will be split evenly via Kraken Pay between everyone that entered.

If anyone would like to provide additional Moons to this giveaway you can send Moons on Kraken Pay to @GabeSter.

Edit: Comments locked on pinned post will get moons sent out hopefully within next 24 hours to everyone that entered before it was locked

Edit 2: comments unlocked, 88 Moons were sent to everyone that dropped their kraktag!",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jahg0k/the_rcryptocurrency_moon_week_59_moon_burn_update/

Comment,1jejxa6,aaj094,1742375427.0,"Isn't the latest STRF preferred stock issue by Strategy a reasonably compelling proposition? It pays a fixed 10% per annum cash dividend (they don't have the leeway of paying dividend in kind using common stock like STRK does) and so they have first claim on any cash left after debt servicing. Further if Strategy ever chooses to miss the dividend, it accumulates for the next period and compounds at 10% + some penalty (upto a max of 18%). Finally, in a liquidation scenario, it shares with STRK first claim on a liquidation value of $100.

So given that Strategy has a huge stack of BTC, doesn't this look like a juicy proposition for STRF holders? They are pretty much going to get made whole even in a very bad scenario (while MSTR shares get obliterated) and till then pay a very juicy 10% fixed yield in cash?

Sure, there is no upside here (though falling interest rates will give some) but rather this is a yield play.",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jejxa6/daily_crypto_discussion_march_19_2025_gmt0/

Tickmill Group analyst Monnelli has suggested in a report that the Federal Reserve might adjust its quantitative tightening plan during its upcoming meeting. The recent meeting minutes highlighted the imminent debt ceiling issue, indicating that 'foreign exchange reserves could experience significant fluctuations in the coming months.' The market strategist noted that this situation might lead the Federal Reserve to 'consider pausing or slowing down the reduction of its balance sheet.'

Comment,1jejxa6,xtra_clueless,1742359097.0,"Just because you \*can\* have it doesn't mean it's likely going to happen. But since I am clueless, maybe enlighten me rather insult? QT is the reduction of the money supply to curb inflation. QE is essentially the opposite: expansion of the money supply, which may lead to inflation later on. So it's either one or the other, no? Just the tools are different. 

What are your arguments why QE will be back soon?

Here's why I think it's unlikely:  
The Fed is cautious with lowering interest rates and is concerned about sticky inflation, which is still above the target. QE is usually something they start when interest rates are near zero. The Fed is still in the process of quantitative tightening and this will probably continue until late this year ([though now maybe at a slower rate](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/fed-watchers-see-good-chance-change-balance-sheet-drawdown-2025-03-18/)). The US economic conditions are still decent, incl. job numbers (though this may change later this year.) Even in the worst case scenario where Trump and tariffs causes a recession, I have doubts that the Fed would reverse course immediately, especially given the sticky inflation.",7,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jejxa6/daily_crypto_discussion_march_19_2025_gmt0/

Comment,1jejxa6,Smiling_Jack_,1742360407.0,"OK, 

First off, these quantitative measures are a new tool, one of many that have been spun up by the Fed since '08.

So when people say you need QE or QT for this or that to happen, they're full of shit because we straight up don't enough data. It's a nascent tool. 

The whole reason it started is because financial institutions levered up on long-term duration assets, those lovely MBSs, that turned out to be fucking worthless.  
So when they collapsed, the Fed stepped in to buy them to put in a floor.

And as most folks know, there's nothing more permanent than a temporary solution.

  
The thing is, QE/QT isn't generic open market ops (Fed Funds rate).  
It's not just a simple buy or sell.

Because with the Fed's balance sheet, changes to the **composition** of its assets are just as, if not more important than the overall net change in its value.  
If the fed is buying relatively liquid assets at a great rate than it is letting illiquid assets run off, or even selling, then you can QE while actually reducing liquidity (aka doing what people assume QT does).

tl;dr the QE/QT discussion is far more nuanced than your basic monetary policy.  
AND, it's very new and we do not have nearly enough data to start making conclusions about marginal changes in its policy.",-2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jejxa6/daily_crypto_discussion_march_19_2025_gmt0/

* Check for the presence of unfamiliar processes or services, particularly those with names similar to ""WWStartupCtrl64.dll""
* Look for unexpected cryptocurrency wallet extensions in your Chrome browser, as StilachiRAT targets 20 different wallet extensions
* Be alert for any signs of credential theft, such as unexpected logins to your accounts or changes to saved passwords in Chrome
* Use network monitoring tools to check for suspicious connections, especially on TCP ports 53, 443, or 16000, which StilachiRAT uses for communication

__How to stay safe from StilachiRAT__

In order to avoid infection from this RAT, Microsoft’s advice is pretty simple: Make sure to only download software from official websites and use security software that can block malicious domains and email attachments.

That means you should install the best antivirus software on your PC and make sure you’re keeping it up to date. You also want to know the common signs of phishing attacks such as misspelled domain names or email signatures, attachments from unknown senders, or messages that contain a sense of urgency or even threats of a legal nature that encourage you to click or download something.

Never click on something that you aren’t expecting or don’t know what it is or who sent it and when in doubt, contact the sender in a separate message or email. If a domain name or URL seems suspicious then go to it directly by typing it into the browser window instead of by clicking on a link. You can also use a VPN to protect your privacy further and a password manager to keep your passwords safe.

New malware strains like this one are created everyday but by practicing good cyber hygiene and staying up to date on the latest attack methods, you can avoid falling victim to StilachiRAT and other online threats.

Comment,1jehzzw,EnjoyerOfBeans,1742352685.0,"This malware specifically only targets Google Chrome system directories on Windows. If you're using any chromium based browser that is not Chrome, or you're not using Windows, you will not be affected by this one in particular (assuming there are no versions of this malware floating around targeting other browsers in the same way). It also isn't a chromium exploit, this can be replicated easily in Firefox as well because it doesn't use any browser vulnerabilities, just decrypts persistent data like your system does when you launch the browser.

The ""vulnerability"" it's exploiting is the fact that people allow their browsers to keep sensitive data that is decrypted any time a browser is open (or even not, by using the Windows API). We've known for years that you should never under any circumstance let your browser save any credentials. They might as well be stored in plain text and there's no way to make it more secure.

Comment,1jehzzw,HaltheDestroyer,1742390266.0,"I developed an algorithm that uses a specific combination of numbers letters special symbols and different cases to generate passwords that are unique for every website I use 

Kind of funny but I developed this process when I was in the U.S. Army and we had to generate super secure passwords for all of our logins that would expire very frequently 

I would explain the process further but so far it has worked out great for me and nothing has been compromise so far

The best part is if one password is compromised the others are safe because every site has an alphanumeric key that I generate as part of the password for every unique site.....and it's all done mentally and never saved to a browser because it's easy to remember mentally as long as you follow the rules of the password

The password length is about 19-22 characters once completed and simple to remember....even my wife has swapped to using this password generation method because she finally admitted it was smart

This will do nothing to help against sites being compromised and data being stolen but at least if they get 1 of my passwords they still don't have the keys to the kingdom",1,0,https://i.redd.it/2352nx48zipe1.jpeg

People loose control of their bank accounts due to the very same virus attacks.

Something which the masses of the world know and care nothing about beyond superficial protection of weak passwords which these viruses can pull from your machines easily.

I don’t fully disagree with your point, shit is still like the Wild West, but the Wild West birthed a generation of humans that would go on to shape the world we comfortably live in today because of the lessons that were learned in the chaos of civilization taking root and stake in an environment that cares nothing for them.

It takes, it hoards, it scars the land.
No feast too full, no hoard too high,
It starves the world yet fears to die.

It whispers soft in silvered lies,
That wealth alone makes wise men wise.
That power’s weight is light to bear,
That need is naught if none compare.

A palace built on broken backs,
A kingdom held through cruelest tax.
A throne of gold, a gilded chain,
Yet still it thirsts, yet still it drains.

It turns the poor against the poor,
It locks compassion past the door.
It sells the sky, it scars the sea,
Then claims itself as destiny.

But what is left when all is sold?
A hollow throne, a king grown cold.
A dragon buried ‘neath its keep,
Alone, afraid, too rich to sleep.

For wealth is dust, and power fades,
And greed will dig its own dark grave.
Yet still it takes, yet still it feeds,
For nothing dies as slow as greed.",-7,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jec87g/cryptocom_just_scammed_their_users_again_and/

So what CDC has scammed people on 3 major circumstances your insistence that they wouldn't paper trade to boost their exchange statistics just shows you're too deep in the red to see reality for what it is.

CDC doesn't make money on paper trades and blew an insane amount of money they didn't have yet on marketing campaigns.

Maybe ask yourself why a CRO and CDC stan is the only person trying to defend CDC despite CDC having radio silence on why this change was needed. If you're truly not an employee think about what CDC is doing and what reasons they could have for doing it, and the radio silence for what's going on. Hint it's not that they ""need more liquidity"" that's not how crypto works. the CRO supply was almost 150x as high as the bitcoin supply and Bitcoin got an ETF. The circulating supply increase was only need to give CDC a way to print money.

On top of that ask yourself why CDC hasn't done an audit since Dec. 2022 and why they won't do an audit that shows their liabilities.

Collective Shift CEO Ben Simpson noted that the current correction is one of only three or four over 25% in this cycle, compared to 12 in the previous cycle. He attributes the delay in the bull run's peak to macroeconomic conditions and global liquidity challenges, which are impacting the crypto market.

Comment,1jer404,coinfeeds-bot,1742367606.0,"tldr; Director Carl Erik Rinsch has been arrested on fraud charges for allegedly misusing $11 million intended for a Netflix series, spending it on cryptocurrency, luxury items, and personal expenses. Despite Netflix investing $55 million in the project, Rinsch failed to deliver any episodes. He faces charges including wire fraud and money laundering, with a potential sentence of up to 90 years in prison. Prosecutors claim he used the funds for speculative trading, luxury purchases, and legal fees, instead of completing the show.
