Comment,1jejxa6,aaj094,1742375427.0,"Isn't the latest STRF preferred stock issue by Strategy a reasonably compelling proposition? It pays a fixed 10% per annum cash dividend (they don't have the leeway of paying dividend in kind using common stock like STRK does) and so they have first claim on any cash left after debt servicing. Further if Strategy ever chooses to miss the dividend, it accumulates for the next period and compounds at 10% + some penalty (upto a max of 18%). Finally, in a liquidation scenario, it shares with STRK first claim on a liquidation value of $100.

So given that Strategy has a huge stack of BTC, doesn't this look like a juicy proposition for STRF holders? They are pretty much going to get made whole even in a very bad scenario (while MSTR shares get obliterated) and till then pay a very juicy 10% fixed yield in cash?

Sure, there is no upside here (though falling interest rates will give some) but rather this is a yield play.",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jejxa6/daily_crypto_discussion_march_19_2025_gmt0/,isnt latest strf preferred stock issue strategy reasonably compelling proposition pay fixed 10 per annum cash dividend dont leeway paying dividend kind using common stock like strk first claim cash left debt servicing strategy ever chooses miss dividend accumulates next period compound 10 penalty upto max 18 finally liquidation scenario share strk first claim liquidation value 100 given strategy huge stack btc doesnt look like juicy proposition strf holder pretty much going get made whole even bad scenario mstr share get obliterated till pay juicy 10 fixed yield cash sure upside though falling interest rate give rather yield play

Comment,1jejxa6,xtra_clueless,1742359097.0,"Just because you \*can\* have it doesn't mean it's likely going to happen. But since I am clueless, maybe enlighten me rather insult? QT is the reduction of the money supply to curb inflation. QE is essentially the opposite: expansion of the money supply, which may lead to inflation later on. So it's either one or the other, no? Just the tools are different. 

What are your arguments why QE will be back soon?

Here's why I think it's unlikely:  
The Fed is cautious with lowering interest rates and is concerned about sticky inflation, which is still above the target. QE is usually something they start when interest rates are near zero. The Fed is still in the process of quantitative tightening and this will probably continue until late this year ([though now maybe at a slower rate](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/fed-watchers-see-good-chance-change-balance-sheet-drawdown-2025-03-18/)).

Comment,1jejxa6,Smiling_Jack_,1742360407.0,"OK, 

First off, these quantitative measures are a new tool, one of many that have been spun up by the Fed since '08.

So when people say you need QE or QT for this or that to happen, they're full of shit because we straight up don't enough data. It's a nascent tool. 

The whole reason it started is because financial institutions levered up on long-term duration assets, those lovely MBSs, that turned out to be fucking worthless.  
So when they collapsed, the Fed stepped in to buy them to put in a floor.

And as most folks know, there's nothing more permanent than a temporary solution.

  
The thing is, QE/QT isn't generic open market ops (Fed Funds rate).  
It's not just a simple buy or sell.

Because with the Fed's balance sheet, changes to the **composition** of its assets are just as, if not more important than the overall net change in its value.  
If the fed is buying relatively liquid assets at a great rate than it is letting illiquid assets run off, or even selling, then you can QE while actually reducing liquidity (aka doing what people assume QT does).

tl;dr the QE/QT discussion is far more nuanced than your basic monetary policy.  
AND, it's very new and we do not have nearly enough data to start making conclusions about marginal changes in its policy.",-2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jejxa6/daily_crypto_discussion_march_19_2025_gmt0/,ok first quantitative measure new tool one many spun fed since 08 people say need qe qt happen theyre full shit straight dont enough data nascent tool whole reason started financial institution levered longterm duration asset lovely mbss turned fucking worthless collapsed fed stepped buy put floor folk know there nothing permanent temporary solution thing qeqt isnt generic open market ops fed fund rate simple buy sell fed balance sheet change composition asset important overall net change value fed buying relatively liquid asset great rate letting illiquid asset run even selling qe actually reducing liquidity aka people assume qt tldr qeqt discussion far nuanced basic monetary policy new nearly enough data start making conclusion marginal change policy

* Run a full system scan using up-to-date antivirus software. Some antivirus programs have specific detection names for StilachiRAT, such as Avast (Win64:MalwareX-gen \[Trj\]), Kaspersky (Backdoor.Win64.Agent.kxj), and Microsoft (TrojanSpy:Win64/Stilachi.A)
* Monitor for unusual system behavior, including unexpected system reboots, suspicious outbound network connections, or unexplained changes to Windows registry values
* Check for the presence of unfamiliar processes or services, particularly those with names similar to ""WWStartupCtrl64.dll""
* Look for unexpected cryptocurrency wallet extensions in your Chrome browser, as StilachiRAT targets 20 different wallet extensions
* Be alert for any signs of credential theft, such as unexpected logins to your accounts or changes to saved passwords in Chrome
* Use network monitoring tools to check for suspicious connections, especially on TCP ports 53, 443, or 16000, which StilachiRAT uses for communication
* Examine your system and security logs for any signs of tampering or clearing, as StilachiRAT has the ability to clear event logs",47,0,https://i.redd.it/2352nx48zipe1.jpeg,wondering affected want check step instructed ai run full system scan using uptodate antivirus software antivirus program specific detection name stilachirat avast win64malwarexgen trj kaspersky backdoorwin64agentkxj microsoft trojanspywin64stilachia monitor unusual system behavior including unexpected system reboots suspicious outbound network connection unexplained change window registry value check presence unfamiliar process service particularly name similar wwstartupctrl64dll look unexpected cryptocurrency wallet extension chrome browser stilachirat target 20 different wallet extension alert sign credential theft unexpected logins account change saved password chrome use network monitoring tool check suspicious connection especially tcp port 53 443 16000 stilachirat us communication examine system security log sign tampering clearing stilachirat ability clear event log

__How to stay safe from StilachiRAT__

In order to avoid infection from this RAT, Microsoft’s advice is pretty simple: Make sure to only download software from official websites and use security software that can block malicious domains and email attachments.

That means you should install the best antivirus software on your PC and make sure you’re keeping it up to date. You also want to know the common signs of phishing attacks such as misspelled domain names or email signatures, attachments from unknown senders, or messages that contain a sense of urgency or even threats of a legal nature that encourage you to click or download something.

Never click on something that you aren’t expecting or don’t know what it is or who sent it and when in doubt, contact the sender in a separate message or email. If a domain name or URL seems suspicious then go to it directly by typing it into the browser window instead of by clicking on a link. You can also use a VPN to protect your privacy further and a password manager to keep your passwords safe.

New malware strains like this one are created everyday but by practicing good cyber hygiene and staying up to date on the latest attack methods, you can avoid falling victim to StilachiRAT and other online threats.

I would explain the process further but so far it has worked out great for me and nothing has been compromise so far

The best part is if one password is compromised the others are safe because every site has an alphanumeric key that I generate as part of the password for every unique site.....and it's all done mentally and never saved to a browser because it's easy to remember mentally as long as you follow the rules of the password

The password length is about 19-22 characters once completed and simple to remember....even my wife has swapped to using this password generation method because she finally admitted it was smart

It whispers soft in silvered lies,
That wealth alone makes wise men wise.
That power’s weight is light to bear,
That need is naught if none compare.

A palace built on broken backs,
A kingdom held through cruelest tax.
A throne of gold, a gilded chain,
Yet still it thirsts, yet still it drains.

It turns the poor against the poor,
It locks compassion past the door.
It sells the sky, it scars the sea,
Then claims itself as destiny.

But what is left when all is sold?
A hollow throne, a king grown cold.
A dragon buried ‘neath its keep,
Alone, afraid, too rich to sleep.

And greed will dig its own dark grave.

* He won't let you look at the home to verify it's not on fire
* The homeowners is aggressively telling people that there is no fire
* He's rushing loads of water to his home
* He isn't telling you why he needs the water

That is the state of CDC at the moment. **There is no smoking gun because CDC isn't letting people see what's going on** by refusing to do more audits, but everything points to CDC likely being at least partially insolvent, and UNTIL THEY DO AN AUDIT YOU SHOULD ASSUME THEY ARE. (don't trust verify).""

\> BuT tHe VoLuMe:

So what CDC has scammed people on 3 major circumstances your insistence that they wouldn't paper trade to boost their exchange statistics just shows you're too deep in the red to see reality for what it is.

CDC doesn't make money on paper trades and blew an insane amount of money they didn't have yet on marketing campaigns.

\> BuT KrIs iS a GoOd BuSsInEsSmAn,

Is that why he ran Ensogo into the ground

...

Maybe ask yourself why a CRO and CDC stan is the only person trying to defend CDC despite CDC having radio silence on why this change was needed. If you're truly not an employee think about what CDC is doing and what reasons they could have for doing it, and the radio silence for what's going on. Hint it's not that they ""need more liquidity"" that's not how crypto works. the CRO supply was almost 150x as high as the bitcoin supply and Bitcoin got an ETF. The circulating supply increase was only need to give CDC a way to print money.

On top of that ask yourself why CDC hasn't done an audit since Dec. 2022 and why they won't do an audit that shows their liabilities.
