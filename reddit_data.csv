# What are Moons:

For the uninitiated Moons are a community and governance token for rCryptoCurrency. They serve many unique purposes such as:

* Earning Moons for participation on the sub.Â [(Yes distributions are back)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ex4s44/moon_week_52/)
* [Voting on Community governance for the sub](https://snapshot.org/#/cryptomods.eth).
* [Burning Moons for a special membership](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1cyvqam/special_memberships_are_now_live_on_rcc/).
* Approved entities can burn Moons to engage on the sub in the form ofÂ [events/amas/others.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencyMeta/comments/1c7b10j/cc_ecosystem_buyers_guide_overview/)
* Off-chain earned Moons can be tipped to other Redditors as an appreciation for their help or contributions on Reddit.

One of the best ways to keep an eye out for updates about Moons on the sub is to look for Moon Week posts which happen once every 28 days. You can find the Moon Week 59 post [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1j5f6tn/moon_week_59/)

# Let's talk Moon Week 59 Moon Burns:

Between February 3rd and March 2nd

* 38,632 Moons wereÂ [burned on Arbitrum Nova](https://nova.arbiscan.io/token/0x0057ac2d777797d31cd3f8f13bf5e927571d6ad0?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead)Â in five unique burn events:
* 229,145 Moons wereÂ [burned on Arbitrum OneÂ ](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x24404dc041d74cd03cfe28855f555559390c931b?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead)in thirteen unique burn events:
* The total number of Moons burned between both chains over the 28 day period is:Â 267,777 Moons.

# Moon Burn Ranking Update:

Moons are the 10th most valuable asset in the burn address on Arbitrum OneÂ **(up one since the** [**last update**](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1is1amf/the_rcryptocurrency_moon_week_58_moon_burn_update/)**)**Â with \~382k Moons having been burned so far on Arbitrum One

Unlike most assets in the burn address on One, no Moons were ever minted for the sole supply of being burned. Nearly all the Moons in the dead address on One were purchased off the open market and burned by web three entities looking to host AMAs or customize the rCC banner.

\-----

Moons remain the most valuable asset in the burn address on Arbitrum Nova with \~2.95M Moons having been burned to date and accounting for over 99.9% of the value of all tokens in the burn address on Arbitrum Nova.

The Moon Week 57 burn update introduced a way to win 500 Moons by guessing how many Moons will be burned in 2025?

Post,1jcje45,Is the bullrun over? A historical risk analysis,AlexWasTakenWasTaken,1742124385.0,"Two months I created a post to take a pulse of the market when we were at all time highs. Since it was super well received, let's update our risk metrics [from the previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1i61phz/crypto_hasnt_even_begun_to_melt_faces_part_2/) and see where we stand after this correction. Clearly, we're not as euphoric as last time. **TL;DR** at the bottom.

Always keep in mind:

>All models are wrong, but some are useful. - George Box

We'll capture the market by taking a weighted average of my favorite metrics:

**Alphasquared (**[**link**](https://alphasquared.io/)**) - 40%**

https://preview.redd.it/fq2kwiikd1pe1.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=e24760e2e72477bf62fe521f7c0bf28431605e53

* This one is my most trusted metric and what I've used for almost two years now to DCA. It was the only one to pinpoint the Bear Market perfectly. With the best track record of all, we weigh this at 40%.
* The current Risk is: **43 out of 100** (down from 60.8)

**Benjamin Cowen (**[**YouTube**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7QLSd6Bj-U&ab_channel=BenjaminCowen)**) - 30%**

https://preview.redd.it/d1d13w3ld1pe1.png?width=2754&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1a535e60835e5218152d5f8990bb6bc4220e2f5

* This one missed the 2022 bottom by a fair bit and it seems to have been quite high when we reached 73 risk. I like to diversify my indicators and there's a certain reputation around this so I'll include it, albeit at a lesser weight of 30%
* The current Risk is: **49 out of 100** (down from 60.6)

**RSI (**[link](https://www.tradingview.com)**) - 20%**

https://preview.redd.it/hfrt7xamd1pe1.png?width=2069&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddbbd6a01bbbdd05d65baaea96c82583927f5d90

* We all know the RSI. It's a trusty indicator, albeit a simple one. This is a weekly timeframe.
* The current Risk is: **47.7 out of 100** (down from 68.8)

**CBBI  (**[link](https://colintalkscrypto.com/cbbi/)**) - 10%**

https://preview.redd.it/d1w0wybnd1pe1.png?width=1110&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4f82a821fcda6d571cfd003ae8851b064c913c5

* This one missed both the top in 2021 and the bottom in 2022, but not by a huge margin. It has since been refitted without mention, but we'll still include it with 10% weight.
* The current Risk is: **70 out of 100** (down from 81). Still elevated but no longer in strong selling territory!

Now, let's combine all of these:

|Indicator|Weight|Current Risk|Weighted Risk|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Alphasquared|40%|43|17.2|
|Benjamin Cowen|30%|49|14.7|
|RSI|20%|47.7|9.54|
|CBBI|10%|70|7.0|
|Totals|100%||48.4 out of 100|

# What This Means

Our weighted risk score has dropped from 64.4 to 48.4 out of 100. This puts us in more neutral territory compared to the elevated risk we saw two months ago. It's worth noting that every previous bull run has featured multiple corrections of 30-40% before reaching the actual market top.

# The Importance of Strategy

Having a clear strategy remains crucial during these market fluctuations. If risk continues decreasing, this presents an opportunity to accumulate at better prices. Conversely, if risk begins climbing again in the coming months, a disciplined DCA-out approach becomes important.

**The worst approach would be to get disinterested and leave the space after incurring losses**. Remember that lower risk environments are precisely when accumulation becomes most beneficial. Even if we enter a bear market, which can be painful and boring, this is historically when the groundwork for significant returns is established.

The core principle remains: the lower risk goes, the more you should consider buying. The higher risk goes, the more you should consider taking profits in incremental steps.

**TL;DR:** The recent 25% drop from ATH has significantly lowered our risk metrics from 64.4 to 48.4. Historical patterns suggest this is a correction rather than the end of the bull market (see charts).",77,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jcje45/is_the_bullrun_over_a_historical_risk_analysis/

Post,1jc4592,Houston crime: Four teens charged in Bitcoin robbery of online streamer,StraightStackin,1742069919.0,"This is why you don't tell anyone you own crypto.

Update to the story, arrests have been made.  Not long ago Amouranth mentioned on a stream she had some Bitcoin ($20m worth.) Not long after that, masked men attempted a robbery at her house demanding the crypto.  She was on the phone with her husband who was in another wing of their property when they invaded, hearing all this through the phone he put on his vest and grabbed his gun.  He waited at the top of a dark stairway assuming she would bring them towards him, which she did, he told her to duck, fired some shots, hit one of the suspects and they feed.  Many did not believe her, they thought it was staged for promotional purposes, but arrests have now been made and surveillance footage released.
