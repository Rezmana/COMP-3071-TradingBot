# What are Moons:

For the uninitiated Moons are a community and governance token for rCryptoCurrency. They serve many unique purposes such as:

* Earning Moons for participation on the sub.Â [(Yes distributions are back)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ex4s44/moon_week_52/)
* [Voting on Community governance for the sub](https://snapshot.org/#/cryptomods.eth).
* [Burning Moons for a special membership](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1cyvqam/special_memberships_are_now_live_on_rcc/).
* Approved entities can burn Moons to engage on the sub in the form ofÂ [events/amas/others.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencyMeta/comments/1c7b10j/cc_ecosystem_buyers_guide_overview/)
* Off-chain earned Moons can be tipped to other Redditors as an appreciation for their help or contributions on Reddit.

One of the best ways to keep an eye out for updates about Moons on the sub is to look for Moon Week posts which happen once every 28 days. You can find the Moon Week 59 post [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1j5f6tn/moon_week_59/)

# Let's talk Moon Week 59 Moon Burns:

Between February 3rd and March 2nd

* 38,632 Moons wereÂ [burned on Arbitrum Nova](https://nova.arbiscan.io/token/0x0057ac2d777797d31cd3f8f13bf5e927571d6ad0?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead)Â in five unique burn events:
* 229,145 Moons wereÂ [burned on Arbitrum OneÂ ](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x24404dc041d74cd03cfe28855f555559390c931b?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead)in thirteen unique burn events:
* The total number of Moons burned between both chains over the 28 day period is:Â 267,777 Moons.

# Moon Burn Ranking Update:

Moons are the 10th most valuable asset in the burn address on Arbitrum OneÂ **(up one since the** [**last update**](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1is1amf/the_rcryptocurrency_moon_week_58_moon_burn_update/)**)**Â with \~382k Moons having been burned so far on Arbitrum One

Unlike most assets in the burn address on One, no Moons were ever minted for the sole supply of being burned. Nearly all the Moons in the dead address on One were purchased off the open market and burned by web three entities looking to host AMAs or customize the rCC banner.

\-----

Moons remain the most valuable asset in the burn address on Arbitrum Nova with \~2.95M Moons having been burned to date and accounting for over 99.9% of the value of all tokens in the burn address on Arbitrum Nova.

# Part 1: crypto.com, Kris, and a brief history of fraud and scams

**Ensogo:**

Before crypto.com Kris Marszalek was the CEO of Ensogo (a Groupon copycat) that defrauded investors, and third parties. Kris would resign as CEO and run away from the problem ultimately leaving an insolvent company that cost everyone else a lot of money. [More reading on Ensogo can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/jf8bx4/history_of_kris_cryptocoms_ceo/). If for some reason you believe it couldn't be the same person [here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzlJZectBY) of Kris shilling how great Ensogo is and how you should work for Ensogo just nine months before Ensogo declared bankruptcy in June of 2016.

https://preview.redd.it/9hvcm7h9phpe1.png?width=1228&format=png&auto=webp&s=9126ff5d094ca6d319d5e90b9b23bfbda36ddfe0

**Monaco:**

Just eleven months after Kris defrauded investors and users at Ensogo, Kris was back with another ~~revolutionary~~ idea, well a **copycat** of another popular idea. Whereas Ensogo attempted to compete with an established competitor (Groupon). Monaco (MCO) attempted to be the first to get in early into a budding field, Crypto Credit Cards.

Kris raised $26M on an ICO for an ERC-20 token called Monaco with plans to launch a Crypto credit card with special rewards for Monaco holders, although plans for this would ultimately stall with no signs of success, Kris would pivot a year later and use his remaining reserves to buy the crypto.com [domain for $12M](https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/6/17540818/crypto-com-domain-matt-blaze-monaco-mco-cryptology-sale). This would lead to Monaco being renamed ""crypto.com"" token and then later being abandoned altogether for a new token called CRO. In 2020 Monaco holders were given a limited amount of time to exchange their MCO for CRO (a new token in which CDC owned nearly all the supply) and at a suboptimal rate. [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/biaud9/monaco_mco_raised_26_million_in_ico_and_promised/)

>To sum up this long tale, Monaco (MCO) raised tens of millions of dollars to launch a cryptocurrency Visa card... The company rebranded itself by buying the $12 million Crypto.com website and renamed Monaco (MCO) to Crypto.com, likely due to numerous users calling Monaco (MCO) a scam. [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/biaud9/monaco_mco_raised_26_million_in_ico_and_promised/)

**The crypto.com credit card debate:**

After defrauding Monaco investors to buy the crypto.com domain, Kris would eventually launch a crypto credit card. Forcing credit card holders to buy CRO from crypto.com and lock it up to get rewards for holding the credit card. Kris repeated one of his tricks from his days at Ensogo, offering rewards that are too good to be true to onboard new users, then pull those rewards and create unhappy users.

\* For the crypto.com credit card it worked like this:

Sell your freshly minted CRO to Users (at no cost to yourself) -> Have them lock up their CRO for a year to get a credit card with ""great"" rewards, dripping the money they gave you back to them -> after a significant number of users are onboarded pull those rewards -> Leave unhappy users to deal with the consequences.

Many users purchased a Credit Card locking up hundreds of thousands of CRO to get rewards, had those rewards slashed - and a year later the value of the token they locked up had lost 75%-90% of it's value costing users thousands to hundreds of thousands.

**Notes:**

Part 1 doesn't cover many sketchy things that crypto.com does like: hosting fake ""giveaways"", and taking advantage of new crypto investors with a ""gamified"" experience that **steals 15% of your money** with spread every time you make a full trade.

\---------------

# Part 2: crypto.com just scammed CRO holders

When crypto.com first launched CRO they minted 100B tokens, before eventually burning 70B tokens in 2021 (as a gimmick) [and said the final supply was 30B. ](https://cryptobriefing.com/70-billion-cro-burned-ahead-crypto-org-chain-launch/)On March 2nd 2025, just four years after the ""burn"" CDC made a proposal to remint the 70B tokens that they previously ""burned"" and to give it to themselves without making it clear how it would be used.

This proposal was put up to a ""democratic vote"" where nearly every user that wasn't CDC rejected the proposal. CDC proceeded to wait until the day before voting closed to steamroll the proposal - with CDC controlling 48% of the voting power and only 70% of validators voting this was all but guaranteed to pass and CDC will be minting 70B in CRO currently worth $5B to give to themselves, devaluing existing CRO holders.

https://preview.redd.it/fiyrftkffhpe1.png?width=1484&format=png&auto=webp&s=52a4c61fc6a881908e9c15a54597e86171d84c5e

In yet another attempt at manipulation immediately after CDC forced the remint of 70B tokens, they made another proposal to burn 50M tokens which they will surely pass for optics.

[https:\/\/www.mintscan.io\/crypto-org\/proposals\/30](https://preview.redd.it/tnrru669ghpe1.png?width=959&format=png&auto=webp&s=24ecd7d2ea1cb7c547515b0c461256c8caea3f1b)

So in other words instead of minting 70B Cro, they're just minting 69.95B Cro...

Kris was mostly silent to the backlash but a few days after the proposal went live they would eventually make one of their only statements saying they needed to mint 70B tokens to create sustainable flows on the ""demand side""

https://preview.redd.it/pdg2yf00hhpe1.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=8898f1383813d26d6f4a4d9edb9be68a450414f8

Or in other words, CRO needed 70B tokens so that they could sell them to third parties for pure profit at no cost to themselves, diluting the value of all existing CRO holders who may want to sell. An absolute garbage excuse for anyone who knows how ""Crypto and Demand of Alts"" actually works.

This is completely contrary to what CDC said they would do in their white paper, use exchange profits to purchase additional CRO, creating an ecosystem where exchange profits are redistribute to CRO holders.

https://preview.redd.it/0ukzivkwhhpe1.png?width=785&format=png&auto=webp&s=c345b611d1549fd59991bae0173fa6606f832d0c

\---------

# Part 3: Why I think crypto.com is likely secretly insolvent

The question becomes why is Crypto.com abandoning their white paper to scam CRO holders, the simple answer is CDC just wants to mint more ""rewards"" for their users at no cost to themselves, but I **think** the truth is something much darker... I think crypto.com is likely secret insolvent.

After FTX collapsed CDC seemed like it would be another exchange to fall given CDCs staking feature and similar business model. CDC survived a smaller exchange run and would eventually release an audit in early December, but just days later the firm that ran it said they weren't confident with the audits and would stop running them since they didn't show liabilities.

[https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/mazars-suspends-crypto-clients-6931106](https://preview.redd.it/1g880c2clhpe1.png?width=980&format=png&auto=webp&s=68995b30dcfaa155b2dc469853bb03b4846503f2)

Crypto.com hasn't had an audit since, **in fact a post from a week ago asking why CDC hasn't had an audit since 2022, has since been deleted or removed from** r/crypto_com

Given the fact that CDC is now blowing up what's left of their reputation to mint $5B it raises even more questions, why would CDC blow up what's left of their reputation? Ensogo did not have a money printer feature to save the company that Kris could use to prevent the company from going under when he ran it into the ground... crypto.com does and we already know from Ensogo that CDC leadership does not have a good track record with actually leading a company.

One of the only things Kris has attempted to repeatedly respond to since this drama began in early March is to aggressively assure users that CDC doesn't have any problems. While continuing to ignore any questions asking for a firm plan of how CDC will use the 70B CRO that they're reminting.

https://preview.redd.it/9ur2wv9gnhpe1.jpg?width=592&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff3c15453b434c0034ffdd10c17d265060a57cee

Kris went out of his way to try and tell users that all of these claims that CDC might be in trouble are ""just falsehoods"", but they're using the emergency built in money printer feature of their platform, they aren't releasing an audit, and their leadership has a very bad history of running companies into the ground

So it other words:

* If a homeowner has a long history of catching his prior homes on fire
* He won't let you look at the home to verify it's not on fire
* The homeowners is aggressively telling people that there is no fire
* He's rushing loads of water to his home
* He isn't telling you why he needs the water

**The house is probably on fire and you probably want to get your money out of that house.**

That appears to be the state of CDC at the moment. **There is no smoking gun because CDC isn't letting people see what's going on** by refusing to do more audits, although it's not guaranteed everything points to CDC likely being at least partially insolvent, and UNTIL THEY RELEASE AN AUDIT I **THINK** IT'S SAFE TO ASSUME THEY ARE. (don't trust verify)

If CDC did have a hole the two thing that might save CDC from going under in a bankrun is their insane fees to take money from the platform and the fact that they encourage users to lock up their funds on the platform which will hide the full extent of the damage by preventing many users from withdrawing during a bankrun (probably what helped save them in 2022 if they were insolvent).

Who knows though, CDC has a plan to mint $5B and give it to themselves. If that works in a few years they might be able to dig themselves out of any hole that they may or may not currently be in.",905,240,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jec87g/cryptocom_just_scammed_their_users_again_and/,know cryptocom ceo kris long full history fraud outright scam ceo cfo cryptocom
