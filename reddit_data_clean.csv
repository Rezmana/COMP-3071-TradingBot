Post,1jgkwkr,The Hilarious & Wild HEX/PulseChain Saga Unfolding Right Now,002_timmy,1742574465.0,"There is some absolute madness happening on Richard Heart's Pulsechain right now. Here's the best summary i can muster.  It's long, but worth the read. 

Richard Heart creates HEX, a token where the only real utility is staking it to print more HEX. People lock up their HEX for years thinking it‚Äôs the future. The HEX contract‚Äôs code is inefficient as hell. When ETH L1 fees spiked in 2021 after the Berlin fork, unstaking HEX costs thousands of dollars in gas.  This was often more than some people‚Äôs entire HEX holdings (LOL).

To ‚Äúfix‚Äù this, Richard basically copy-pastes Ethereum, including all its chain state, to create PulseChain. This was supposed to be a low-fee fork where HEX can live on as pHEX. He raises a billion dollars for this, takes 2 years to launch, but eventually pulls it off.

Richard pushes everyone to treat pHEX (PulseChain‚Äôs HEX) as the ‚Äúreal‚Äù one, claiming the Ethereum version is dead and ‚Äúthe market has decided,‚Äù continuing the grift.

Since basically all of Ethereum was forked, this means every Ethereum contract at the snapshot are forked. Most are broken, but some can be salvaged if you grab enough governance tokens and fix dependencies/oracles.

For some wild reason, For some reason, the HEX community latches onto the forked MakerDAO contract. Nobody knows how this came to be other than a hive mid effort.

Some random dude who goes by the name ""Maria"" comes along and says he's invented true randomness and worked with NASA and a bunch of bullshit. Maria's real name is James Ellis Osborne III.  Like Richard Heart, Maria likes to wear glittery, flashy clothing. 

https://preview.redd.it/1y4ndxf2f2qe1.png?width=872&format=png&auto=webp&s=65d46780b77759cfa556cfa4d550e9dbbf63cbff

Pulsechain has pDAI, a forked version of the DAI stablecoin, which Maria scoops up for virtually nothing and pairs it in AMMs with other random PulseChain tokens. ""HEXicans"" (name HEX holders call themselves) think he's a genius because they don't understand what he's doing or why but his shirt is glitters like Richard's so he must be smart /s. 

A myth spreads that pDAI will hit $1 because Maria and Richard will ‚Äúfix‚Äù the Maker contract and save PulseChain. This pumps pDAI to $0.02-$0.03. People start dreaming of ‚Äúthe peggening‚Äù - a mythical event where pDAI hits $1. Richard start bragging about pDAI price movement. Half the ecosystem buys in, fueled by wild theories that Richard‚Äôs 95% ownership of his coins (not sure why this wasn't a massive red flag) could somehow collateralize the 50 billion pDAI supply. The math doesn‚Äôt math, but HEXicans don‚Äôt care.

While all this is happening, Richard is silent. He's facing ongoing legal battles with the SEC and Interpol for essentially a ton of fraud. He still tweets from time to time and everyone reads the tea leaves and says his tweets mean he's going to peg pDAI.  There is absolutely no evidence of this in his tweets. 

**But wait.... here's where it gets good.** 

Turns out the PulseChain MakerDAO pDAI contract is fucked. Some random address can mint unlimited pDAI.  They start printing tens of millions, dump it for other coins, and bridge to mainnet. 

Maria (the glittery shirt guy) starts freaking out because all his projects are tied to this massive liquidity pool he set up between pDAI and his own project coins, which are then paired to all other core coins in the ecosystem, which are basically all going to 0. 

Maria's solution? Go on a live-stream and just dump $300k of pDAI and call DAI a counterfeiting scam that is targeting ""crypto pioneers"" (LMFAO). He seemingly has a psychotic break and claims the scammers his family rifle from his aunt‚Äôs home in Kentucky and is seeking asylum.  He says something about employing contractors affiliated with the DAI group (if you are having a tough time following, welcome to the club)

Richard (remember, who was bragging about pDAI price movement) starts tweeting how he was never involved in the project and says he hates fake narratives, essentially gaslighting HEX holders. But HEXicans don't believe him and start saying he ""has"" to say that since it's a bad look to be involved.

Pulsechain token (PLS) is basically rekt to the point it can never recover, but HEX influencers are still telling people this isn't a crisis but a buying opportunity. One person is claiming someone from ETH is going to buy $330M worth of PLS.

Whoever the pDAI minter is can basically make infinite money as long as Pulsechain users keep bridging assets to the chain.

Post,1jg4e96,The first crypto.com scam was worse than you realize. They STOLE over 99% of all tokens from Monaco holders. No that's not a typo they stole over 99% of CRO tokens.,GabeSter,1742517446.0,"If you've been following the recent crypto.com drama you probably have heard of the first crypto.com scam, the forced convert of tokens from Monaco to CRO before abandoning Monaco their ICO token entirely. You probably don't know just how bad this scam actually was though. When crypto.com forced the swap from Monaco to CRO, they gave Monaco holders less than 1% of the supply in the new token and giving over 99% of the supply to themselves.

\---

**Before we go too deep, lets first refresh how this scam went down for anyone not yet familiar.**

Before crypto.com was crypto.com they were, Monaco. Monaco raised $26M in 2017 through an ICO of erc-20 token promising to launch crypto credit cards with ""big rewards"". This went absolutely nowhere and in 2018 the Monaco team pivoted and spent $12M of their remaining funds to purchase the crypto.com domain. Renaming the Monaco token the crypto.com token, and in 2020 the team abandoned this token all together in favor of their newer token which they had more control over - CRO. Giving Monaco holders a limited amount of time to swap from Monaco to CRO.  You can find a longer read on it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/biaud9/monaco_mco_raised_26_million_in_ico_and_promised/)

# Now here's where things takes a really dark turn.

Monaco had a circulating supply of: \~31.587M token

Which can be confirmed with wayback machine from 2019.

[https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20190421005509\/https:\/\/etherscan.io\/token\/0xb63b606ac810a52cca15e44bb630fd42d8d1d83d](https://preview.redd.it/m7o94sonmxpe1.png?width=437&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce45b2f8dac7b9127d4b2d40305992e3c211ec50)

The Monaco to CRO swap rate was 1 to 27.64. This swap rate can be confirmed from a now deleted August 2020 crypto.com blog post pulled from wayback machine

[https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20200927064258\/https:\/\/blog.crypto.com\/important-announcement-mco-swap\/](https://preview.redd.it/quixwsh1nxpe1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d5547b1c57f766736f044a58d8c4d05721a7295)

If we do the math: 31,587,682 \* 27.6439 = 873.2M CRO was set aside for Monaco holders if everyone claimed (they didn't) - and Cro has a total supply of 100B tokens.

* .873% of CRO went to Monaco holders
* 99.127% of CRO went to Crypto.com

Or in other words crypto.com stole 99.127% of the supply of the new token from existing Monaco holders on the forced swap to CRO.

**Had Monaco holders been giving a proportionate amount of CRO based off the share they owned before the forced swap: Monaco holders would have been given 3,165.8 CRO for every 1 Monaco they owned. Instead they were given.... 27.6.**..

crypto.com stole over 99.1% of the new CRO token from Monaco holders and gave it to themselves. They then proceeded to dump that on crypto.com credit card buyers as a way to raise even more money, offering rewards that crypto.com knew wasn't sustainable. But that's a story for a different post.

*Note: CRO supply had already been partially distributed by crypto.com prior to this forced swap so depending on how many Monaco crypto.com themselves owned they may not have never been able to give a perfectly equal distribution. However considering that CDC would later ""burn"" and ""unburn"" 70B CRO (70% of supply), it's safe to say they could have done a much fairer distribution to their OG token holders compared to the less than 1% that they actually distributed. Additionally CDC could have purchased Monaco until they had a share equal to the amount of CRO they had already distributed.*

*Had this been stocks and not Crypto, Kris would probably have gone to jail for stealing 99% of tokens in a forced swap.*

*-------*

Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm an amateur stock investor and a newbie in the crypto market, trying to learn the ropes. Recently, I joined a Telegram channel called **CRYPTO PUMP CLUB**, which has over 440,000 members. They basically organize pump-and-dump trades on decentralized exchanges.

I‚Äôve seen their last two executions:

	‚Ä¢	**$VANCE**: 5,947% gains

	‚Ä¢	**$JFK**: 2,703% gains

The numbers look insane, but I‚Äôm wondering‚Äîhas anyone actually made real profits from these schemes? Or is this just a classic scam where the insiders win, and the majority lose?

Would love to hear from anyone who has participated in similar groups. Are these pumps worth the risk, or is it just a trap for naive traders like me?

That made it the biggest crypto failure in history until FTX collapsed in 2023. Jed still had a small stake when it crashed. He said he lost money too. He wasn‚Äôt fined or charged.

He moved on to XRP. He co-created the Ripple protocol. He also held 9% of all XRP when it launched. He had disagreements with his co-founders and left Ripple in 2013.

But he kept his XRP and sold it slowly over the next decade. From 2014 to 2022, he made about $3.2 billion by selling XRP and Ripple shares. That‚Äôs according to XRPScan, which tracks transactions on the XRP Ledger.""

Back in 2021, with just $500, I managed to grow it to $10,000. I then invested part of it in SHIBA, and even though I wasn‚Äôt an early adopter, it turned out to be a great move. Then the bear market took everything back.

Early investors are always the biggest winners.

 Look at Mubarak: $232 ‚û° $1.1 million. The guy got in early, taking advantage of low liquidity and sudden hype. But this isn‚Äôt a game for everyone. Many get caught in rug pulls or worthless memecoins.

 Exchange listings are often a strong signal.

 Personally, I prefer waiting until a token lands on a solid exchange before jumping in. Bitget, for example, listed ACX, SHELL, THENA early‚Äîprojects that later made it to Binance with solid price action.
But let‚Äôs be real: not everyone can be an early investor. Between VCs, insiders, whales, and influencers, it‚Äôs hard to get in at the right moment.

There's been a shift of interest by major players in this field. Talking about Exchanges their CEOs, VCs, etc  
Majority are now focusing on actually building something with crypto.  
But why now? Why not when there were other projects as old as ethereum?  
Because memecoins & shitcoins were where the money was at. Exchanges VCs and shady dev teams have been riding this easy money bandwagon for too long.   
But they can only fool retail so long... Interests are shifting, either people leaving the market alltogether or simply going after what's actually building something.  


# Exchanges are in a do or die situation: 

  
Exchanges cannot hope to ride another bullmarket on memecoins & shitcoins that do jackshit besides pump & dump. I believe it's a do or die right now environment for them.  
If exchanges can't shift the narrative to something else they risk losing retail forever, and it's pretty hard to convince new people to join crypto now with so much scams rugs memecoins etc...  
  
Will they finally back your +4 yo project? prob not. Why? Because it built nothing in those years.  
Haven't seen anything outside crypto. Projects are just trying to compete for security/privacy or speed on blockchain.

# Part 1: crypto.com, Kris, and a brief history of fraud and scams

**Ensogo:**

Before crypto.com Kris Marszalek was the CEO of Ensogo (a Groupon copycat) that defrauded investors, and third parties. Kris would resign as CEO and run away from the problem ultimately leaving an insolvent company that cost everyone else a lot of money. [More reading on Ensogo can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/jf8bx4/history_of_kris_cryptocoms_ceo/). If for some reason you believe it couldn't be the same person [here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzlJZectBY) of Kris shilling how great Ensogo is and how you should work for Ensogo just nine months before Ensogo declared bankruptcy in June of 2016.

https://preview.redd.it/9hvcm7h9phpe1.png?width=1228&format=png&auto=webp&s=9126ff5d094ca6d319d5e90b9b23bfbda36ddfe0

**Monaco:**

Just eleven months after Kris defrauded investors and users at Ensogo, Kris was back with another ~~revolutionary~~ idea, well a **copycat** of another popular idea. Whereas Ensogo attempted to compete with an established competitor (Groupon). Monaco (MCO) attempted to be the first to get in early into a budding field, Crypto Credit Cards.

Kris raised $26M on an ICO for an ERC-20 token called Monaco with plans to launch a Crypto credit card with special rewards for Monaco holders, although plans for this would ultimately stall with no signs of success, Kris would pivot a year later and use his remaining reserves to buy the crypto.com [domain for $12M](https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/6/17540818/crypto-com-domain-matt-blaze-monaco-mco-cryptology-sale). This would lead to Monaco being renamed ""crypto.com"" token and then later being abandoned altogether for a new token called CRO. In 2020 Monaco holders were given a limited amount of time to exchange their MCO for CRO (a new token in which CDC owned nearly all the supply) and at a suboptimal rate. [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/biaud9/monaco_mco_raised_26_million_in_ico_and_promised/)

>To sum up this long tale, Monaco (MCO) raised tens of millions of dollars to launch a cryptocurrency Visa card... The company rebranded itself by buying the $12 million Crypto.com website and renamed Monaco (MCO) to Crypto.com, likely due to numerous users calling Monaco (MCO) a scam. [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/biaud9/monaco_mco_raised_26_million_in_ico_and_promised/)

**The crypto.com credit card debate:**

After defrauding Monaco investors to buy the crypto.com domain, Kris would eventually launch a crypto credit card. Forcing credit card holders to buy CRO from crypto.com and lock it up to get rewards for holding the credit card. Kris repeated one of his tricks from his days at Ensogo, offering rewards that are too good to be true to onboard new users, then pull those rewards and create unhappy users.

\* For the crypto.com credit card it worked like this:

Sell your freshly minted CRO to Users (at no cost to yourself) -> Have them lock up their CRO for a year to get a credit card with ""great"" rewards, dripping the money they gave you back to them -> after a significant number of users are onboarded pull those rewards -> Leave unhappy users to deal with the consequences.

Many users purchased a Credit Card locking up hundreds of thousands of CRO to get rewards, had those rewards slashed - and a year later the value of the token they locked up had lost 75%-90% of it's value costing users thousands to hundreds of thousands.

**Notes:**

Part 1 doesn't cover many sketchy things that crypto.com does like: hosting fake ""giveaways"", and taking advantage of new crypto investors with a ""gamified"" experience that **steals 15% of your money** with spread every time you make a full trade.

\---------------

# Part 2: crypto.com just scammed CRO holders

When crypto.com first launched CRO they minted 100B tokens, before eventually burning 70B tokens in 2021 (as a gimmick) [and said the final supply was 30B. ](https://cryptobriefing.com/70-billion-cro-burned-ahead-crypto-org-chain-launch/)On March 2nd 2025, just four years after the ""burn"" CDC made a proposal to remint the 70B tokens that they previously ""burned"" and to give it to themselves without making it clear how it would be used.

This proposal was put up to a ""democratic vote"" where nearly every user that wasn't CDC rejected the proposal. CDC proceeded to wait until the day before voting closed to steamroll the proposal - with CDC controlling 48% of the voting power and only 70% of validators voting this was all but guaranteed to pass and CDC will be minting 70B in CRO currently worth $5B to give to themselves, devaluing existing CRO holders.

https://preview.redd.it/fiyrftkffhpe1.png?width=1484&format=png&auto=webp&s=52a4c61fc6a881908e9c15a54597e86171d84c5e

In yet another attempt at manipulation immediately after CDC forced the remint of 70B tokens, they made another proposal to burn 50M tokens which they will surely pass for optics.

[https:\/\/www.mintscan.io\/crypto-org\/proposals\/30](https://preview.redd.it/tnrru669ghpe1.png?width=959&format=png&auto=webp&s=24ecd7d2ea1cb7c547515b0c461256c8caea3f1b)

So in other words instead of minting 70B Cro, they're just minting 69.95B Cro...

Kris was mostly silent to the backlash but a few days after the proposal went live they would eventually make one of their only statements saying they needed to mint 70B tokens to create sustainable flows on the ""demand side""

https://preview.redd.it/pdg2yf00hhpe1.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=8898f1383813d26d6f4a4d9edb9be68a450414f8

Or in other words, CRO needed 70B tokens so that they could sell them to third parties for pure profit at no cost to themselves, diluting the value of all existing CRO holders who may want to sell. An absolute garbage excuse for anyone who knows how ""Crypto and Demand of Alts"" actually works.

This is completely contrary to what CDC said they would do in their white paper, use exchange profits to purchase additional CRO, creating an ecosystem where exchange profits are redistribute to CRO holders.

https://preview.redd.it/0ukzivkwhhpe1.png?width=785&format=png&auto=webp&s=c345b611d1549fd59991bae0173fa6606f832d0c

\---------

# Part 3: Why I think crypto.com is likely secretly insolvent

The question becomes why is Crypto.com abandoning their white paper to scam CRO holders, the simple answer is CDC just wants to mint more ""rewards"" for their users at no cost to themselves, but I **think** the truth is something much darker... I think crypto.com is likely secret insolvent.

After FTX collapsed CDC seemed like it would be another exchange to fall given CDCs staking feature and similar business model. CDC survived a smaller exchange run and would eventually release an audit in early December, but just days later the firm that ran it said they weren't confident with the audits and would stop running them since they didn't show liabilities.

[https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/mazars-suspends-crypto-clients-6931106](https://preview.redd.it/1g880c2clhpe1.png?width=980&format=png&auto=webp&s=68995b30dcfaa155b2dc469853bb03b4846503f2)

Crypto.com hasn't had an audit since, **in fact a post from a week ago asking why CDC hasn't had an audit since 2022, has since been deleted or removed from** r/crypto_com

Given the fact that CDC is now blowing up what's left of their reputation to mint $5B it raises even more questions, why would CDC blow up what's left of their reputation? Ensogo did not have a money printer feature to save the company that Kris could use to prevent the company from going under when he ran it into the ground... crypto.com does and we already know from Ensogo that CDC leadership does not have a good track record with actually leading a company.

One of the only things Kris has attempted to repeatedly respond to since this drama began in early March is to aggressively assure users that CDC doesn't have any problems. While continuing to ignore any questions asking for a firm plan of how CDC will use the 70B CRO that they're reminting.

https://preview.redd.it/9ur2wv9gnhpe1.jpg?width=592&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff3c15453b434c0034ffdd10c17d265060a57cee

Kris went out of his way to try and tell users that all of these claims that CDC might be in trouble are ""just falsehoods"", but they're using the emergency built in money printer feature of their platform, they aren't releasing an audit, and their leadership has a very bad history of running companies into the ground

So it other words:

* If a homeowner has a long history of catching his prior homes on fire
* He won't let you look at the home to verify it's not on fire
* The homeowners is aggressively telling people that there is no fire
* He's rushing loads of water to his home
* He isn't telling you why he needs the water

**The house is probably on fire and you probably want to get your money out of that house.**

That appears to be the state of CDC at the moment. **There is no smoking gun because CDC isn't letting people see what's going on** by refusing to do more audits, although it's not guaranteed everything points to CDC likely being at least partially insolvent, and UNTIL THEY RELEASE AN AUDIT I **THINK** IT'S SAFE TO ASSUME THEY ARE. (don't trust verify)

If CDC did have a hole the two thing that might save CDC from going under in a bankrun is their insane fees to take money from the platform and the fact that they encourage users to lock up their funds on the platform which will hide the full extent of the damage by preventing many users from withdrawing during a bankrun (probably what helped save them in 2022 if they were insolvent).

Who knows though, CDC has a plan to mint $5B and give it to themselves. If that works in a few years they might be able to dig themselves out of any hole that they may or may not currently be in.",1132,272,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jec87g/cryptocom_just_scammed_their_users_again_and/,know cryptocom ceo kris long full history fraud outright scam ceo cfo cryptocom

Post,1jf9xnu,StilachiRat - Possible Attack Vectors and Ingress Routes,vengeful_bunny,1742423841.0,"**tldr;**

The sad truth is at the moment, Microsoft has reported that it does not know the exact method people are ending with this fairly awful trojan that steals passwords, steals cryptocurrency, monitors clipboard activity, and logs keys.    
  
Some points:

Given the concern about whether StilachiRAT can infect systems simply by visiting a webpage or opening an email (without any user action), it‚Äôs important to note that **no evidence** of a zero-day ‚Äúdrive-by‚Äù exploit has been reported for this malware. Microsoft‚Äôs disclosure did not indicate that StilachiRAT leverages any previously unknown vulnerability to magically install itself without user involvement‚Äã

Microsoft explicitly warns that trojanized software installers are a possible distribution vector for this RAT

StilachiRAT Infection Vectors and Delivery Methods

**Overview:** StilachiRAT is a newly identified Windows Remote Access Trojan (RAT) known for stealth and data theft. Because it was only discovered in late 2024, researchers have not yet pinpointed a single definitive infection method‚Äã

[thehackernews.com](https://thehackernews.com/2025/03/microsoft-warns-of-stilachirat-stealthy.html#:~:text=It%27s%20currently%20not%20clear%20how,to%20implement%20adequate%20security%20measures). Microsoft notes that it‚Äôs *‚Äúnot clear how the malware is delivered‚Äù* and warns that such RATs can arrive through *‚Äúvarious initial access routes‚Äù*‚Äã [thehackernews.com](https://thehackernews.com/2025/03/microsoft-warns-of-stilachirat-stealthy.html#:~:text=It%27s%20currently%20not%20clear%20how,to%20implement%20adequate%20security%20measures). In practice, this means StilachiRAT could be distributed via multiple common malware vectors. Below we examine the likely infection avenues and how users are unknowingly installing it, based on reputable security analyses and observed tactics.

# Malicious Email Attachments or Links

One probable vector is phishing emails carrying malicious attachments or links. Threat actors often trick users into running an attached file (e.g. a fake document, installer, or macro-laden Office file) or clicking a link that downloads malware‚Äã

[pcrisk.com](https://www.pcrisk.com/removal-guides/32439-stilachirat-malware#:~:text=Threat%20actors%20deliver%20malware%20using,support%20scams%20and%20malicious%20advertisements). **Microsoft‚Äôs guidance and reports from researchers explicitly include email-based delivery as a risk for StilachiRAT** ‚Äã[securityweek.com](https://www.securityweek.com/microsoft-warns-of-new-stilachirat-malware/#:~:text=The%20company%20has%20not%20specified,software%2C%20malicious%20websites%2C%20and%20email). In many RAT incidents, attackers send emails impersonating trusted entities to induce victims to open a booby-trapped file. For example, Field Effect analysts noted a campaign (unrelated to StilachiRAT but illustrative) where a phishing email to a helpdesk system was used to deploy RAT malware ‚Äã[fieldeffect.com](https://fieldeffect.com/blog/stilachirat-scurrying-crypto-wallets#:~:text=While%20the%20exact%20delivery%20mechanism,hosted%20help%20desk%20software). This suggests StilachiRAT could similarly arrive via a *‚Äúmalicious email‚Ä¶ sent to the target‚Äôs‚Äù* organization, carrying the Trojan in an attachment or linked download‚Äã[fieldeffect.com](https://fieldeffect.com/blog/stilachirat-scurrying-crypto-wallets#:~:text=vulnerabilities%20and%20malicious%20software%20bundles,hosted%20help%20desk%20software). In short, a user might unknowingly install StilachiRAT by opening a file from a spear-phishing email, believing it to be legitimate, when in fact it executes the RAT payload.

# Malicious Websites and Drive-By Downloads

StilachiRAT may also spread through compromised or malicious websites, including drive-by downloads. **Security experts note that RATs like StilachiRAT are often delivered via exploit kits on hacked websites or malvertising pages**‚Äã

[fieldeffect.com](https://fieldeffect.com/blog/stilachirat-scurrying-crypto-wallets#:~:text=While%20the%20exact%20delivery%20mechanism,hosted%20help%20desk%20software). In such a scenario, simply visiting an infected website (or viewing a malicious ad) could trigger a silent download if the user‚Äôs browser or plugins have known vulnerabilities. Microsoft‚Äôs incident report cautions that *‚Äúmalicious websites‚Äù* are among the possible initial infection vectors for this RAT‚Äã[securityweek.com](https://www.securityweek.com/microsoft-warns-of-new-stilachirat-malware/#:~:text=The%20company%20has%20not%20specified,software%2C%20malicious%20websites%2C%20and%20email). Drive-by download attacks typically require no explicit user action: the website attempts to exploit a browser or software flaw to execute malware in the background. While the *exact* web-based delivery method for StilachiRAT remains unconfirmed, researchers advise that outdated browsers or insecure plug-ins could be exploited to drop the trojan without the user realizing‚Äã[pcrisk.com](https://www.pcrisk.com/removal-guides/32439-stilachirat-malware#:~:text=Threat%20actors%20deliver%20malware%20using,support%20scams%20and%20malicious%20advertisements). In practice, this means a user could get infected simply by browsing a compromised site that stealthily installs StilachiRAT (if their system isn‚Äôt fully patched). However, at this time StilachiRAT has not been tied to any specific exploit kit or web-based 0-day attack; the possibility is raised mainly because it‚Äôs a common RAT tactic ‚Äã[fieldeffect.com](https://fieldeffect.com/blog/stilachirat-scurrying-crypto-wallets#:~:text=While%20the%20exact%20delivery%20mechanism,hosted%20help%20desk%20software).

# Exploiting Software Vulnerabilities

Another potential infection route is the exploitation of unpatched software vulnerabilities (beyond the browser alone). Many modern malware campaigns leverage known flaws in operating systems, document viewers, or other software to execute code. **Reports indicate that threat actors could install StilachiRAT by exploiting vulnerabilities in outdated software on the target machine**‚Äã

[pcrisk.com](https://www.pcrisk.com/removal-guides/32439-stilachirat-malware#:~:text=Threat%20actors%20deliver%20malware%20using,support%20scams%20and%20malicious%20advertisements). For instance, a crafted file (like a PDF, Office document, or LNK shortcut) exploiting a vulnerability could drop the RAT when opened. Likewise, if the attacker gains access through a vulnerable remote service, they might directly deploy StilachiRAT as part of the compromise. Field Effect‚Äôs analysis notes that RATs are *‚Äútypically delivered \[via\] exploit kits targeting software vulnerabilities‚Äù* when users visit the wrong site‚Äã [fieldeffect.com](https://fieldeffect.com/blog/stilachirat-scurrying-crypto-wallets#:~:text=While%20the%20exact%20delivery%20mechanism,hosted%20help%20desk%20software). While no specific CVE or 0-day has been attributed to StilachiRAT‚Äôs spread so far, the malware **could** piggyback on known exploits (if a victim hasn‚Äôt applied patches). In summary, any critical security hole in Windows or common apps ‚Äî if left unpatched ‚Äî might be used as an entry point for attackers to execute the StilachiRAT payload on a system.

# Trojanized and Pirated Software Downloads

Downloading software from unofficial sources is another way users might unwittingly install StilachiRAT. **Microsoft explicitly warns that trojanized software installers are a possible distribution vector for this RAT**‚Äã

[securityweek.com](https://www.securityweek.com/microsoft-warns-of-new-stilachirat-malware/#:~:text=The%20company%20has%20not%20specified,software%2C%20malicious%20websites%2C%20and%20email). This implies the malware may be hidden inside what appears to be a normal program. For example, cybercriminals could bundle StilachiRAT with *‚Äúcracking tools or pirated software‚Äù* shared on forums or torrent sites‚Äã[pcrisk.com](https://www.pcrisk.com/removal-guides/32439-stilachirat-malware#:~:text=Threat%20actors%20deliver%20malware%20using,support%20scams%20and%20malicious%20advertisements). When a user runs the pirated game or ‚Äúactivation‚Äù tool, it silently installs the RAT in the background. Field Effect researchers likewise mention *‚Äúmalicious software bundles from unofficial download sites‚Äù* as a typical delivery mechanism for threats like StilachiRAT ‚Äã[fieldeffect.com](https://fieldeffect.com/blog/stilachirat-scurrying-crypto-wallets#:~:text=While%20the%20exact%20delivery%20mechanism,hosted%20help%20desk%20software). In practical terms, if someone downloads a freeware app, cheat, or installer from an untrusted website, that software could be pre-infected with StilachiRAT. The user sees the expected program functionality, but behind the scenes the RAT is dropped onto the system. To avoid this, experts advise only obtaining software from reputable, official sources and be wary of any ‚Äútoo good to be true‚Äù downloads‚Äã[hackread.com](https://hackread.com/stilachirat-exploits-chrome-crypto-wallets-credentials/#:~:text=Mitigations%20and%20Protections)‚Äã[pcrisk.com](https://www.pcrisk.com/removal-guides/32439-stilachirat-malware#:~:text=How%20to%20avoid%20installation%20of,malware).

# Other Infection Methods (RDP, USB and Social Engineering)

Apart from email and web downloads, **attackers have other tactics to propagate StilachiRAT**. These methods rely on either misconfigured systems or human error to get the malware onto a PC. For example, security researchers highlight the following possibilities:

* **Brute-force RDP attacks:** Hackers might systematically guess or crack Remote Desktop Protocol credentials on an exposed Windows machine, and once they gain access, manually install StilachiRAT on that system‚Äã[fieldeffect.com](https://fieldeffect.com/blog/stilachirat-scurrying-crypto-wallets#:~:text=self). This is an indirect vector (compromising the network service first, malware second) but effectively allows installation without the user launching a file themselves.
* **Infected USB drives:** Threat actors can use USB *‚Äúdroppers‚Äù* ‚Äì USB sticks pre-loaded with an autorun script or Trojan ‚Äì left in public or given as fake promotional devices. When an unsuspecting user plugs it in, it can automatically execute and install the RAT‚Äã [fieldeffect.com](https://fieldeffect.com/blog/stilachirat-scurrying-crypto-wallets#:~:text=self).
* **Social engineering scams:** Techniques like tech support scams or malicious links shared via social media can also lead to infection‚Äã [pcrisk.com](https://www.pcrisk.com/removal-guides/32439-stilachirat-malware#:~:text=systems,support%20scams%20and%20malicious%20advertisements). In a tech support scam, for instance, the victim is convinced to download and run a ‚Äúremote support‚Äù tool which is actually StilachiRAT. Similarly, links on forums or chats (purporting to be something benign) could lead to a download if the user isn‚Äôt cautious‚Äã [pcrisk.com](https://www.pcrisk.com/removal-guides/32439-stilachirat-malware#:~:text=systems,support%20scams%20and%20malicious%20advertisements).

These ‚Äúalternative‚Äù vectors show that **user interaction (though often unwitting) is usually involved** ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs a user reusing weak passwords (enabling RDP compromise), physically inserting unknown USBs, or being tricked by fraudulent messages. All such methods ultimately aim to *‚Äútrick users into performing actions leading to malware execution‚Äù*‚Äã

[pcrisk.com](https://www.pcrisk.com/removal-guides/32439-stilachirat-malware#:~:text=Additionally%2C%20cybercriminals%20can%20distribute%20malware,actions%20leading%20to%20malware%20execution). This underscores why good security hygiene (strong passwords, not plugging in unknown devices, and skepticism of unsolicited offers) is vital to avoid infection.

# Any Zero-Day or Zero-Click Exploits?

Given the concern about whether StilachiRAT can infect systems **simply by visiting a webpage or opening an email (without any user action)**, it‚Äôs important to note that **no evidence of a zero-day ‚Äúdrive-by‚Äù exploit has been reported for this malware**. Microsoft‚Äôs disclosure did not indicate that StilachiRAT leverages any previously unknown vulnerability to magically install itself without user involvement‚Äã

[thehackernews.com](https://thehackernews.com/2025/03/microsoft-warns-of-stilachirat-stealthy.html#:~:text=It%27s%20currently%20not%20clear%20how,to%20implement%20adequate%20security%20measures). Instead, all indications are that it arrives via the conventional means described above, which generally require either the user to run a file or the presence of an unpatched security hole. In other words, there‚Äôs *no* sign of a *‚Äúclickless‚Äù* infection vector (no *automatic* compromise just from opening an email or loading a web page) specific to StilachiRAT at this time. SecurityWeek‚Äôs coverage explicitly states the RAT *‚Äúcan be installed through multiple attack vectors, including trojanized software, malicious websites, and email‚Äù* ‚Äã[securityweek.com](https://www.securityweek.com/microsoft-warns-of-new-stilachirat-malware/#:~:text=The%20company%20has%20not%20specified,software%2C%20malicious%20websites%2C%20and%20email) ‚Äì all of which involve either social engineering or known exploit paths. If simply reading an email or browsing were enough to infect a fully patched system, that would imply a severe 0-day; researchers have **not** observed such behavior. In summary, **StilachiRAT does** ***not*** **appear to spread via any novel zero-click mechanism**. Users are typically infected because they were deceived into running something (or had a vulnerable system that was targeted), rather than through any magical one-glance infection. Keeping software up-to-date and practicing safe browsing/email habits are thus effective defenses, as they cut off the likely avenues this Trojan uses for ingress ‚Äã[hackread.com](https://hackread.com/stilachirat-exploits-chrome-crypto-wallets-credentials/#:~:text=Microsoft%20levels%20StilachiRAT%20as%20a,Safe%20Attachments%20for%20Office%20365)‚Äã[pcrisk.com](https://www.pcrisk.com/removal-guides/32439-stilachirat-malware#:~:text=How%20to%20avoid%20installation%20of,malware).

Post,1jft6qc,Devastated I lost money trading meme coins,Tough_Ad_6806,1742488772.0,"*Serious advice only*

I‚Äôm currently unemployed and thought I could make some money trading on Axiom and scalping meme coins. 

I started with $100 and said that was the most I was going to spend. I jumped straight in without research, thinking I knew better. 

After losing that money I knew I could make it back with more research and following pro traders. So I kept trying. 

I didn‚Äôt even realize until it was too late, eventually I lost $1,000. It then hit me that it‚Äôs not okay and I need to make it back. So I researched more and obtained more knowledge. I saw some gains eventually and it quickly went back down to nothing. 

I kept telling myself I needed to make this money back. Unfortunately, I ended up chasing this loss to get it back and wound up spending $2,000.

This was over the course of 2 months. Eventually I toned it down to smaller trades, but that wound up to be a $300 loss.

So now, I‚Äôm just even more depressed than I was. I stopped trading. I only do research to see if one day I can make it back. It seems unlikely at this point. I really wanted this to work out and now I‚Äôm just scared to trade. Not sure what to do, and regret even trying to do this. But at the same time, I wanted this to workout. I‚Äôve lost around $2,300 that I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll never get back.

On one hand, the government-issued digital currencies demonstrate their potential to reduce transaction costs but on the other hand, create huge operation risks, especially when it comes to privacy.

Take China's Digital Yuan, for example. Its transaction restrictions and government monitoring are alarming because they limit individuals' personal freedom who oppose government laws. This kind of system has funds frozen, donations censored, and so raises concerns about financial freedom.

Post,1jf92a4,CLC - A new revolutionary type of crypto,EveningMix2357,1742421571.0,"WE KNOW THIS IS LONG BUT BELIEVE US, IT'S WORTH READING.



General idea:

CLC - Centralized Ledger Coin is a new type of cryptocurrency that questions the current methods of crypto. We have asked ourselves the original question - How to make a currency that is safe and allow no single entity can control it? 10 years ago, Satoshi solved this problem by using a decentralized approach and blockchain tech. We have created a new solution inspired by Satoshi's blockchain - we created chain-of-ownership technology. This technology fundamentally relies on cryptography and transparency.



Transactions:

Each coin always has a holder - a cryptographic public key, for this example - John. When this holder wants to give this coin, to say Bob, Bob generates a public key that he will use to receive John's coin. To cryptographically secure this, John must leave a signature that he wants to give the coin to Bob. He then sends his signature alongside Bob's public address to the centralized ledger, which accepts it if the signature is valid and contains Bob's public key. This is then added to the coin's transaction history, and Bob is now the official holder of this coin, and he can repeat this process. This is the fundamental idea of CLC.

VISUAL EXAMPLE OF CHAIN-OF-OWNERSHIP AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE: [https://clc-crypto.github.io/coin/?id=224](https://clc-crypto.github.io/coin/?id=224)



Mining:

To introduce new coins to the market, CLC uses PoW mining. Miners race to find a cryptographic key pair that, when hashed, meets a certain difficulty criterion (e.g., starts with 6 sequential zeros). Once someone finds such a key pair, he submits it to the ledger, which, once verified, adds it to the public ledger and gives it a value (of CLC) denoted by the equation (-x / 1,000,000) + 50, where x is the total circulation of CLC.



Simply,

\- CLC relies on transparency and cryptography to be the most secure cryptocurrency to this day.

\- CLC is completely anonymous, has no wallets, and is untraceable to the real-life holder.

\- CLC is fair for miners. We prioritized CPU mining instead of GPU & ASIC to make CLC more friendly for smaller miners.

\- CLC replaces blockchain technology with chain-of-ownership technology to secure it and make it centralized without any downsides of current blockchain approaches.

\- CLC makes users store each coin locally on their computers to ensure maximum security.

\- CLC is Bitcoin in 2010 if Satoshi came up with a different, elegantly simple approach. Period. DON'T MISS OUT THIS TIME!

So I deposited some etherium to coinpoker pretty recently but I did something wrong and the money didn't appear in my balance. I got in contact with support but they need me to verify my wallet before we continue. To verify my wallet I need to make a deposit from it, however, I sent all crypto I had with my last deposit that didn't go through so I don't have any left. I bought my etherium from coinbase which has a long hold period before you can send anything off of it so that would take way too long. I suppose one solution would be buying crypto from a different exchange but I noticed my bank won't let me buy crypto unless I do it through paypal. Are there any good alternatives?

It's basically gold, except significantly easier to store, send, and receive.

There will always be a demand for that kind of asset, especially among the rich who want to keep as much wealth as possible. It's very much available globally, or I guess to anybody with an internet connection. The energy issue is likely to only get better with time. Even during the years when the fed does a great job at combating inflation, not every country will be so lucky. Russian and Chinese oligarchs losing trust in their countries currency and choosing to store some amount of their wealth in bitcoin instead still benefits those of us who hold regardless of what country you're in.

***The full blog post with all the tables is***¬†[here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-74)***.***

Welcome! This is the latest report for my homemade 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund. This group contains¬†**BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, EOS, XLM, USDT, LTC, BSV**, and¬†**Tron.**

**SNAPSHOTS ALWAYS TAKEN ON FIRST OF THE MONTH (data below reflects 1 MARCH Snapshot).**

**tl;dr:**

* **What's this all about?**¬†I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, no selling or trading, reporting monthly for over 7 years. Did the same in 2019 - 2024.¬†***Learn more about the history, rules, and FAQs of the Experiments (including the answer to the ""WHY TETHER?!?!"" question)***¬†[here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***
* **Month 74 update (since Jan. 2019): BTC**¬†in the overall lead by a health margin followed by¬†**ETH**¬†then¬†**Tron**
* 2019 Top Ten Portfolio up¬†+588%, 80% of coins in the green.¬†***Total Crypto market +2,124% over same time period.***
* **2018+2019+2020+2021+2022+2023+2024+2025 Top Ten Portfolios combined are returning +237% compared to +64% with S&P500 if invested similarly.**

# Month Seventy-Four ‚Äì UP 588%¬†¬†

https://preview.redd.it/n00759ayy8pe1.png?width=896&format=png&auto=webp&s=84b79512b1fc134b05b495e76503c8d4af5b4145

The 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund consists of:¬†**BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, EOS, Stellar, USDT, Litecoin, BSV,**¬†and¬†**Tron**. ¬†

February highlights for the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio:¬†

* Bloody month, as all cryptos end February in the red except¬†**Litecoin**
* **Ethereum**¬†knocked out of first place by¬†**Bitcoin**, which maintains a strong overall lead since January 2019 (+2,170%).¬† Third place is¬†**Tron.**

# February Ranking and Dropout Report

https://preview.redd.it/4pe0d81zy8pe1.png?width=271&format=png&auto=webp&s=19c45df9d903505a45b43c0fc60faa4c7857193a

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2019:**¬†After seventy-four months, 50% of the cryptos that¬†[started in the Top Ten in January 2019](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/)¬† have been knocked out.

**BSV**¬†has fallen the furthest in rank so far (#92).

# February Winners and Losers¬†

***February Winners***¬†‚Äì¬†**Litecoin**¬†(+0.3%) outperformed the rest of the Top Ten by breaking even.¬†¬†

***February Losers***¬†‚Äì Tough month for the E coins:¬†**ETH**¬†and¬†**EOS**¬†lost -32% and -31% respectively.

# Overall Update: BTC surpasses ETH for the overall lead.¬† 80% of cryptos in positive territory, EOS in the basement.

**Bitcoin**¬†(+2,170% since Jan. 2019), trailing¬†**Ethereum**¬†in the 2019 Portfolio for years, has now overtaken second place¬†**ETH.**¬†

**The $100 investment into first place BTC on**¬†[**January 1st, 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/)¬†**is currently worth $2,314.**

After seventy-four months, 80% of the cryptos in the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio are in positive territory. The worst performer is¬†**EOS**¬†(-78%)**.**

# Total Market Cap for the Entire Cryptocurrency Sector:

https://preview.redd.it/fwx03hoxz8pe1.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=a57b3895f94615c9acef66f159b90d68a73d7836

There was no easy way to do so at the time, but if you were able to capture the entire cryptocurrency market since¬†[January 2019](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/), you would be up +2,124%

This is still behind first place¬†**BTC**¬†(+2,170%) but just barely and much better than the rest of the Top Ten cryptos, including second place¬†**Ethereum**¬†(+1,511%).¬†¬†

The total market is performing much better than the Top Ten approach (+588%) as well.

Crypto Market Cap Low Point in the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment:¬†**$114B in**¬†[**January 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/).

# Bitcoin Dominance:

https://preview.redd.it/trhpfuryz8pe1.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&s=0300273dcbe95ee16a96589295cd632da73ea8ef

**BitDom**¬†ended February at 60.1%.

For context, here are the high and low points of¬†**BTC**¬†domination over the life of the 2019 Experiment:

Low Point in the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment:¬†[**38.1% in November 2022.**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46)

High Point in the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment:¬†[**70.5% in August 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-eight/).

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2019:

https://preview.redd.it/2dh8376109pe1.png?width=301&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d27b97a1ef68e7875b5e44640e4fa3c76922143

After seventy-four months, the value of the initial $1000 investment is¬†**$6,875**¬†up +588%. This is down from¬†[November 2021‚Äôs all time high](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-35)¬†of +665% for the 2019 Portfolio.¬†

Although the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio is up +588%, it is not the best performing of the eight Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment Portfolios: it is still a distant second place behind the¬†[2020 Top Ten Portfolio](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56)¬†which is up +809% at the moment.

# Combining the 2018 ‚Äì 2025 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios¬†

Speaking of other Top Ten Portfolios, let‚Äôs put all eight together now:

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-85): up +34% (total value $1,342)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-74): up +588% (total value $6,875)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +809% (total value $9,088) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45): up +294% (total value $3,942)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34): up -21% (total value $793) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-23): up +162% (total value $2,619)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12): up +48% (total value $1,483)
* [2025 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-2): up -18% (total value $816)

So overall? Taking the eight portfolios together:

**After a $8,000 total investment in the 2018 ‚Äì 2025 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,**¬†the combined portfolios are worth¬†**$26,959**

https://preview.redd.it/0caly35b09pe1.png?width=442&format=png&auto=webp&s=41a6f4795b187b6c3804a030f432e151c73bb19f

**That‚Äôs up +237%**¬†on the combined portfolios.¬† The peak¬† for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was¬†[**November 2021‚Äôs all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/)¬†of¬†**+533%**.

Here‚Äôs the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/b4gn25xc09pe1.png?width=1074&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb3192318ac4312f1a44ab35e776cd65dfb838a8

In summary:¬†***That‚Äôs a +237% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for eight straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500:

I‚Äôm also tracking the S&P 500 as part of the experiments to have a comparison point with traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/1yw205ii09pe1.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fd0689ede225b41ecfc11a8c7a490ea3c80d11e

Because the S&P 500 Index is up 138% since January 2019, the initial $1k investment I put into crypto seventy-four months ago would be worth $2,376 had it been redirected to the S&P 500 in January 2019.¬†

But what if I took the same world‚Äôs-slowest-dollar-cost-averaging $1,000-per-year-on-January-1st-Crypto-Index-Fund-Experiment approach with the S&P 500? It would yield the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,228 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,376 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,844 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,585 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,249 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,551 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,248 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2025 = $1,012 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P:¬†

**After eight $1,000 annual investments on January 1st into an S&P 500 index fund from 2018 to 2025 my portfolio would be worth $13,095.**

That is up¬†**+64%**¬†[since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/)¬†compared to a¬†**+237%**¬†gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.¬†¬†

Here‚Äôs a table providing an overview of the eight year ROI comparison between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P:¬†

# Conclusion:

To both old-timers and newcomers: thanks so much for taking the time to read and for supporting the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments.

Post,1jcje45,Is the bullrun over? A historical risk analysis,AlexWasTakenWasTaken,1742124385.0,"Two months I created a post to take a pulse of the market when we were at all time highs. Since it was super well received, let's update our risk metrics [from the previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1i61phz/crypto_hasnt_even_begun_to_melt_faces_part_2/) and see where we stand after this correction. Clearly, we're not as euphoric as last time. **TL;DR** at the bottom.

Always keep in mind:

>All models are wrong, but some are useful. - George Box

We'll capture the market by taking a weighted average of my favorite metrics:

**Alphasquared (**[**link**](https://alphasquared.io/)**) - 40%**

https://preview.redd.it/fq2kwiikd1pe1.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=e24760e2e72477bf62fe521f7c0bf28431605e53

* This one is my most trusted metric and what I've used for almost two years now to DCA. It was the only one to pinpoint the Bear Market perfectly. With the best track record of all, we weigh this at 40%.
* The current Risk is: **43 out of 100** (down from 60.8)

**Benjamin Cowen (**[**YouTube**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7QLSd6Bj-U&ab_channel=BenjaminCowen)**) - 30%**

* This one missed the 2022 bottom by a fair bit and it seems to have been quite high when we reached 73 risk. I like to diversify my indicators and there's a certain reputation around this so I'll include it, albeit at a lesser weight of 30%
* The current Risk is: **49 out of 100** (down from 60.6)

**RSI (**[link](https://www.tradingview.com)**) - 20%**

* We all know the RSI. It's a trusty indicator, albeit a simple one. This is a weekly timeframe.
* The current Risk is: **47.7 out of 100** (down from 68.8)

**CBBI  (**[link](https://colintalkscrypto.com/cbbi/)**) - 10%**

* This one missed both the top in 2021 and the bottom in 2022, but not by a huge margin. It has since been refitted without mention, but we'll still include it with 10% weight.
* The current Risk is: **70 out of 100** (down from 81). Still elevated but no longer in strong selling territory!

Now, let's combine all of these:

|Indicator|Weight|Current Risk|Weighted Risk|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Alphasquared|40%|43|17.2|
|Benjamin Cowen|30%|49|14.7|
|RSI|20%|47.7|9.54|
|CBBI|10%|70|7.0|
|Totals|100%||48.4 out of 100|

# What This Means

Our weighted risk score has dropped from 64.4 to 48.4 out of 100. This puts us in more neutral territory compared to the elevated risk we saw two months ago. It's worth noting that every previous bull run has featured multiple corrections of 30-40% before reaching the actual market top.

# The Importance of Strategy

Having a clear strategy remains crucial during these market fluctuations. If risk continues decreasing, this presents an opportunity to accumulate at better prices. Conversely, if risk begins climbing again in the coming months, a disciplined DCA-out approach becomes important.

**The worst approach would be to get disinterested and leave the space after incurring losses**. Remember that lower risk environments are precisely when accumulation becomes most beneficial. Even if we enter a bear market, which can be painful and boring, this is historically when the groundwork for significant returns is established.

The core principle remains: the lower risk goes, the more you should consider buying. The higher risk goes, the more you should consider taking profits in incremental steps.

**TL;DR:** The recent 25% drop from ATH has significantly lowered our risk metrics from 64.4 to 48.4. Historical patterns suggest this is a correction rather than the end of the bull market (see charts).",1013,140,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jcje45/is_the_bullrun_over_a_historical_risk_analysis/,two month created post take pulse market time high since super well received let update risk metric previous post see stand correction clearly euphoric last time tldr bottom always keep mind model wrong useful george box well capture market taking weighted average favorite metric alphasquared link 40 one trusted metric ive used almost two year dca one pinpoint bear market perfectly best track record weigh 40 current risk 43 100 608 benjamin cowen youtube 30 one missed 2022 bottom fair bit seems quite high reached 73 risk like diversify indicator there certain reputation around ill include albeit lesser weight 30 current risk 49 100 606 rsi link 20 know rsi trusty indicator albeit simple one weekly timeframe current risk 477 100 688 cbbi link 10 one missed top 2021 bottom 2022 huge margin since refitted without mention well still include 10 weight current risk 70 100 81 still elevated longer strong selling territory let combine indicatorweightcurrent riskweighted risk alphasquared4043172 benjamin cowen3049147 rsi20477954 cbbi107070 totals100484 100 mean weighted risk score dropped 644 484 100 put u neutral territory compared elevated risk saw two month ago worth noting every previous bull run featured multiple correction 3040 reaching actual market top importance strategy clear strategy remains crucial market fluctuation risk continues decreasing present opportunity accumulate better price conversely risk begin climbing coming month disciplined dcaout approach becomes important worst approach would get disinterested leave space incurring loss remember lower risk environment precisely accumulation becomes beneficial even enter bear market painful boring historically groundwork significant return established core principle remains lower risk go consider buying higher risk go consider taking profit incremental step tldr recent 25 drop ath significantly lowered risk metric 644 484 historical pattern suggest correction rather end bull market see chart

Post,1jcvbfo,Bitcoin‚Äôs Market Cycle: Are We in a Right- or Left-Translated Cycle?,nerdben,1742158022.0,"Bitcoin is at a crucial post-halving inflection point. Prices have surged past previous highs but now face macroeconomic uncertainty. The big question:

üëâ **Are we in a right-translated cycle with more upside ahead, or has Bitcoin already peaked, signaling a prolonged bear market?**

This post is based on a discussion paper I've published a few days ago ([Full read](https://nerdben.substack.com/p/bitcoin-market-cycle-right-translated) / [PDF](https://nerdben.com/20250313-MarketCycleRighLeft-DiscussionPaper.pdf)) exploring **six key macroeconomic and market indicators** shaping Bitcoin‚Äôs current cycle and what they mean for future price appreciation.

# Recap on Bitcoin‚Äôs Market Cycles

Bitcoin follows a **four-year cycle**, historically peaking **12-18 months post-halving**. But **this cycle is different** \- Bitcoin hit an **all-time high BEFORE the halving** for the first time ever. The current cycle (measured from the last bottom) began in early November 2022.

[Four-Year Bitcoin Market Cycles](https://preview.redd.it/myg9i7o022pe1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=10ce38747b85d91dfbd4cd2637fea76b28f3e019)

**I assume two market cycle scenarios:**

* **Right-Translated Cycle (Bullish)** ‚Üí Extended uptrend, peak closer to 2025-2026
* **Left-Translated Cycle (Bearish)** ‚Üí Early peak, prolonged downturn

# üî• So, which one are we in?

In the following let's take a look on key indicators driving Bitcoin's market cycle and examine their current trends, outlooks, and potential macroeconomic implications.

**1. M2 Global Supply (Liquidity)**

* Expanding again but slower than previous cycles
* If liquidity continues rising, it supports a **right-translated cycle**

[M2 Global Supply \(taken from 21 central banks\)](https://preview.redd.it/yuncc5l232pe1.png?width=1416&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffdf1fdca08946f6d1b638268f5a65028336af21)

**2. Core PCE Inflation (Fed‚Äôs Key Inflation Measure)**

* Inflation still above 2% target but declining
* Fed policy decisions and unemployment trends will determine whether inflation stabilizes or rebounds. The risk of stagflation needs to be monitored.
* If inflation remains sticky, Fed may delay rate cuts ‚Üí **Left-Translated Cycle**

[Core PCE Inflation](https://preview.redd.it/frp70kgi32pe1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=5afdeae5f6d18e5ce84f457f6834f6af2f770839)

**3. Unemployment Rate**

* Stabilized at 4.1%, but risks of job losses are rising
* Current U.S. administration's layoff policies need to be monitored (we'll know more with the upcoming jobs report on April 4, 2025)
* If inflation stays high despite rising unemployment, the Fed faces a tough choice: keep rates high, risking economic distress, or cut them to boost jobs while fueling inflation. This decision will be key to 2025's macro outlook.
* If unemployment spikes, Fed may cut rates sooner ‚Üí **Right-Translated Cycle**

[Unemployment Rate](https://preview.redd.it/qb6cd42742pe1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=85446f6e7dd379bb9e2e8d27811c9b7458952443)

**4. Fed Funds Rate**

* Rates Targets were cut to 4.50% but remain high
* If rate cuts accelerate, lending stimulation and credit expansion will increase overall liquidity in the financial system ‚Üí **Right-Translated Cycle**,
* If rates stay high ‚Üí **Left-Translated Cycle**

[Fed Funds Target Rates](https://preview.redd.it/19vu6haq42pe1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bc5fdf60703c5fd90fd2573156725e33f7c1073)

**5. NASDAQ Composite (Stock Market Correlation)**

* Peaked in **Dec 2024**, currently declining
* Historically, Bitcoin‚Äôs price has exhibited a strong correlation with equities. A downturn in equity markets can lead to weakened investor confidence in speculative assets, increasing selling pressure on cryptocurrencies, particularly in a left-translated cycle.
* If stocks rebound ‚Üí Bitcoin follows (bullish)
* If stocks keep dropping ‚Üí Bitcoin likely enters **Left-Translated Cycle**

Lastly, I examined ETF Net Flows, which have been crucial this cycle and closely correlate with price action.

**6. ETF Net Flows (Institutional Demand)**

* **Net inflows turned negative in Feb 2025**
* The significant outflows observed since late February 2025 suggest waning institutional confidence in the market. If net flows remain negative for an extended period, this can serve as a bearish signal, indicating sustained selling pressure and potential downside risk.
* If inflows resume ‚Üí **Right-Translated Cycle**
* If outflows continue ‚Üí **Left-Translated Cycle**

[ETF Net Flows](https://preview.redd.it/t7fiovhr72pe1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=28bd484c9775f074223503953cd6fac22a756e81)

# Let's discuss the scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Left-Translated Cycle Scenario**

With Bitcoin reflecting risk-off sentiment since February 2025, the likelihood of a left-translated cycle has become increasingly relevant. In contrast to previous post-halving cycles, where Bitcoin‚Äôs peak typically occurred 12‚Äì18 months after the halving, this scenario suggests that Bitcoin may have already reached its cycle high on January 20, 2025. By continuously delaying further rate cuts, the Fed keeps liquidity tight and weakening stock markets drag Bitcoin lower. This means, the market is about to enter a prolonged bear phase lasting up to 1.5 years, if aligning with the time frames observed in the last two cycles.

**Supporting arguments for Scenario 1:**

* **ETF adoption absorbed liquidity too early.** The introduction of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 led to massive institutional inflows in Q3 and Q4 2024. Bitcoin ETFs absorbed liquidity during a phase of expanding M2 Global Supply, creating an early demand surge that front-loaded buying pressure and was unique to this cycle.
* **Bitcoin reached an all-time high before the halving.** In all previous cycles, Bitcoin‚Äôs all-time high (ATH) came 12-18 months after the halving. This cycle, Bitcoin hit an ATH at $73K$ before the April 2024 halving - a first in Bitcoin‚Äôs history.
* **Liquidity tightened post-Q2 2024.** While M2 Global expanded during Q1 and Q2 2024, liquidity conditions tightened in Q3 and Q4 as the Fed maintained high interest rates and repeatedly postponed rate cuts before finally lowering rates to 475 bps in December 2024.
* **ETF netflows have turned negative.** Since February 2025, ETF Net Flows turned negative, suggesting institutions are de-risking or taking profits.
* **NASDAQ Composite and Bitcoin are showing correlated weakness.** Historically, Bitcoin has followed a risk-on/risk-off pattern with equities. The NAS- DAQ Composite peaked in Q4 2024, and since then, market sentiment has weakened.
* **Quantitative Easing is not the Fed‚Äôs tool of choice.** The Fed has not signaled any immediate plans for Quantitative Easing (QE).

**Validity of Scenario 1**:

The early peak in ETF-driven demand has reduced the likelihood of a sustained post-halving rally, including a blow-off phase. Net inflows from Bitcoin ETFs turned negative in Q1 2025, indicating that institutional investors are already taking profits rather than accumulating, limiting further upside potential. In past cycles, the post-halving supply shock was a key driver of price appreciation. However, this cycle deviates from historical norms as Bitcoin peaked pre-halving, suggesting that demand was pulled forward and exhausted earlier than expected.

While the U.S. economy has avoided recession longer than anticipated, recession risks remain. A risk-off environment can further dampen institutional demand for Bitcoin, reinforcing downward price pressure. Additionally, the Fed‚Äôs cautious stance has restrained speculative sentiment, preventing the retail-driven euphoria that typically characterizes late-cycle market behavior. Meanwhile, M2 Global liquidity growth has slowed, and elevated borrowing costs are constraining new debt issuance, limiting the flow of fresh capital into risk assets.

If the stock market enters a prolonged correction, Bitcoin is unlikely to decouple and may face continued selling pressure. Historical left-translated market cycles, such as the 2000 dot-com crash and the 2007 financial crisis, saw tech stocks peaking early, only to decline sharply. Bitcoin, strongly correlated with equities and representing a liquidity- sensitive asset, follows a similar trajectory.

**Scenario 2: Right-Translated Cycle Scenario**

The recent 30% decline in Bitcoin‚Äôs price remains within the bounds of a typical market correction, given the asset‚Äôs historically high volatility in an open and liquid market (comparable to April‚ÄìMay 2021). This does not necessarily indicate a deviation from the expected right-translated cycle structure. Based on the last two cycles, Bitcoin is projected to reach its cycle peak approximately 1,050 days after the previous market bottom, placing the expected peak in early Q4 2025. In the mid-term, supportive economic policies from the current U.S. administration, along with expected monetary easing from the Fed in early H2 2025, provide the foundation for renewed market growth.

**Supporting arguments for Scenario 2:**

* **Post-election year market weakness is historically temporary.** Historically, post-election years tend to be weak for equities from February to April before rallying in the second half of the year.
* **Historical cycle timing still leaves room for a second peak.** The past two market cycles have lasted for 12-18 months post-halving before topping out.
* **M2 Global money supply has been expanding again.** Despite a resumed growth phase in H2 2024, the M2 Global has been expanding again, increasing available liquidity.
* **Inflation is slowly decreasing towards the Fed‚Äôs 2% target.** After taking a break from its rapid decrease in H2 2024, the Core PCE (YoY) is again on track reaching the Fed‚Äôs target rate of 2% setting the ground for looser financial conditions.
* **Unemployment is not rising.** The Unemployment Rate has stabilized rather than surging with the labor market remaining strong enough to prevent a full economic contraction. Historically, deep bear markets require rising unemployment, which is not occurring.
* **ETF net outflows have been declining again.** Recent data shows declining outflows suggesting that at some point inflows will resume and lead to renewed institutional demand.

**Validity of Scenario 2:**

Historically, the right-translated cycle has been the base case in previous Bitcoin market cycles, following a typical 12‚Äì18 month post-halving rally. The current downturn in Q1 2025 appears to be seasonal rather than cyclical, largely influenced by post-election year market weakness, which has historically resolved with a recovery in the second half of the year.

Macroeconomic indicators suggest that the risk of a severe recession remains lower than feared, reducing the likelihood of further liquidity tightening. The labor market re- mains stable, with unemployment rates not surging, allowing for continued economic expansion. Additionally, inflation is steadily declining toward the Fed‚Äôs 2% target, strengthening expectations for rate cuts in H2 2025. If the Fed follows through on this, looser financial conditions will result in M2 expansion, improving overall market liquidity and risk-on sentiment.

ETF net outflows have been gradually declining, indicating that selling pressure is easing. A shift from net outflows to net inflows will signal a renewed phase of institutional demand, which reinforces the right-translated scenario. If these factors align positively, Bitcoin will follow historical cycle timing, with a potential cycle peak in early Q4 2025.

**CONCLUSION**

Both a **right- and left-translated cycle scenario can be supported by strong arguments**, reflecting the market‚Äôs current state of macroeconomic uncertainty. Core macro indicators have yet to establish sustained long-term trends, which may be attributed to the new U.S. administration‚Äôs mixed and partly contradictory policies. However, such uncertainty is not uncommon in early post-election years. Ultimately, the **key determining factor will be the trajectory of monetary policy leading into summer 2025**, particularly whether M2 Global expands, as historical data suggests a strong correlation between its growth and Bitcoin price developments.

So far, the Fed has refrained from reintroducing rate hikes, primarily due to stabilizing unemployment rates. Additionally, **declining inflation** supports the case for further rate cuts. **If this trend continues and unemployment remains stable or declines, the probability of monetary easing increases, strengthening the foundation for a right-translated cycle with renewed, growing demand.**

**However, the long-term economic implications of the administration‚Äôs policies, particularly its re-industrialization agenda and reshoring efforts, must be closely monitored.** Recent layoffs and potential increases in the unemployment rate can negatively impact sentiment, reducing the probability of expansionary fiscal policies. Additionally, the introduction of new tariffs introduces further uncertainty. While tariffs may temporarily boost domestic employment, the higher import costs can drive inflation higher, potentially delaying Fed rate cuts and tightening liquidity conditions.

**From mid-April 2025, with fresh labor market and inflation data available, along with another Fed testimony, the probabilities of a left- versus right-translated cycle will become clearer.**

TL;DR: Bitcoin‚Äôs cycle hinges on macro conditions & liquidity. A Right-Translated Cycle means more upside into 2025-2026, while a Left-Translated Cycle suggests Bitcoin already peaked in Q1 2025. Declining inflation and stable or falling unemployment increase the likelihood of rate cuts, reinforcing a right-translated cycle with renewed demand.

I've been working on a platform that tracks all major tokenization projects bringing real-world assets onto blockchain. Think real estate (RealT), bonds (Backed Finance), gold (Paxos), stocks, and other traditional assets now available on-chain.

For each project, the platform already tracks:

* Asset types
* Underlying blockchain
* Current ROI
* Total Value Locked (TVL)
* Smart contract audits
* Project documentation

**My question to you:** If you're interested in RWA investments, what would make this platform genuinely useful for YOUR needs?

Would you want:

* Performance comparisons between similar projects?
* Risk assessments?
* Historical ROI data?
* Regulatory compliance status?
* Integration with portfolio trackers?
* Alerts for new tokenized assets?

I'm building this for the community, so your input will directly shape what features get prioritized.

Thanks for any suggestions!",3,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jd9wwn/im_building_a_comprehensive_database_of_tokenized/,hey crypto community ive working platform track major tokenization project bringing realworld asset onto blockchain think real estate realt bond backed finance gold paxos stock traditional asset available onchain project platform already track asset type underlying blockchain current roi total value locked tvl smart contract audit project documentation question youre interested rwa investment would make platform genuinely useful need would want performance comparison similar project risk assessment historical roi data regulatory compliance status integration portfolio tracker alert new tokenized asset im building community input directly shape feature get prioritized thanks suggestion

* Maybe gradual unlocks instead of cliff vesting
* Better ways to spot the sketchy projects before they blow up
* Something that makes on-chain data actually make sense to normal people

Curious what you all think. If you were going to fix the meme coin space, what safety features would actually matter to you? What would make you trust a new project more?

Instead of the stability and massive pump many expected, we‚Äôve been hit with rug pulls, hacks, MEV attacks, and an overall sense of uncertainty. The $1.14B Bybit hack forced OKX to suspend its DEX aggregator, while Uniswap suffered a $215K MEV bot attack, prompting Bitget Wallet to upgrade its MEV protection in response.  
  
With all this happening, myself and a lot of traders have shifted towards DEXs. The rise in trading volume speaks for itself, people are looking for alternatives, causing more DEX activity.

As for memecoins, they pop up now and then, and if you're early, you might squeeze out a win, if not, well, you‚Äôre just donating to the devs.

Post,1jcnkag,"We had the most unprecedented avalanche of bullish news. But despite all that, everything is being held back because of tariff wars causing market fear. In the unlikely event that the tariff war is resolved, it would be like opening the flood gates to a sleeping stampede of bulls.",fan_of_hakiksexydays,1742137839.0,"We've had some pretty bullish cycles in the past.

I remember in 2017 when some of the big bullish news during the bull market were things like the launch of CME for Bitcoin. But mainly, the bar was still low at ""wow look at all these new Bitcoin ATMs"".

In the 2021 bull market, people were really bullish on things like Elon jumping on Doge coin and NFTs.

But keep in mind, for every major piece of bullish news we had, there was a hell of a lot more FUD and bearish news within crypto.

In 2017 and 2021, we still had institutions and governments wanting to clamp down on crypto at every turn.

Countries like India banning the use of crypto.

China banning crypto mining.

We had the media painting crypto in a very negative light, and we had a lot more FUD headlines about the space than what we see today.

But we had nowhere near the level of bullish news we have now with major institutions jumping on crypto, ETFs actually getting implemented, major legislative red tape getting removed, the media being more neutral and sometimes positive in their portrayal of crypto, major progress in utility and adoption on the tech side, and even countries adopting crypto and starting a race to build crypto reserves.

We went from countries putting out legislation to clamp down on crypto, to countries wanting to build crypto reserves.

All the while, the only major negative news in this space we've had so far that comes to mind is the Bybit hack. Which has already blown over and has been forgotten.

But the bullrun and all the bullish outlook has been held back by one giant problem that has held bulls like a giant dam: Trump's tariff war.

Traditional markets are reacting the same way, with fear, and bulls being stopped dead in their tracks.

That barrier has been stopping the market and holding back the crypto bullrun like a giant dam.

In the unlikely event those policies are resolved, it would be like a dam collapsing that was holding back a stampede of bulls crushing shorts on their way out.",19,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jcnkag/we_had_the_most_unprecedented_avalanche_of/,weve pretty bullish cycle past remember 2017 big bullish news bull market thing like launch cme bitcoin mainly bar still low wow look new bitcoin atm 2021 bull market people really bullish thing like elon jumping doge coin nfts keep mind every major piece bullish news hell lot fud bearish news within crypto 2017 2021 still institution government wanting clamp crypto every turn country like india banning use crypto china banning crypto mining medium painting crypto negative light lot fud headline space see today nowhere near level bullish news major institution jumping crypto etf actually getting implemented major legislative red tape getting removed medium neutral sometimes positive portrayal crypto major progress utility adoption tech side even country adopting crypto starting race build crypto reserve went country putting legislation clamp crypto country wanting build crypto reserve major negative news space weve far come mind bybit hack already blown forgotten bullrun bullish outlook held back one giant problem held bull like giant dam trump tariff war traditional market reacting way fear bull stopped dead track barrier stopping market holding back crypto bullrun like giant dam unlikely event policy resolved would like dam collapsing holding back stampede bull crushing short way

Has this ever happened before? Not a good look for Bitocin.

I saw a recent post on X by a Bitcoin OG, Pierre Rochard, saying ""Bitcoin is all about holding for 5 years. It's time arbitrage."" It used to be 4 years. It's always been 4 years. Why the change in narrative?

So now that we're changing that narrative., what else?

It's a 5 years cycle now. Bitcoin no longer money or currency, but digital gold and a Store of Value meant to be held only. Forget what the pesky whitepaper said about peer to peer cash.

Also, another pattern broken, Bitcoin did not double after 4 years. This is also the first time this has happened. 

I'm sick of all the Bitcoin influencers who change their narrative every time Bitoicn does its own thing and proves everybody wrong. Literally nothing can be predicted or even assumed. Pattern after pattern is broken. 

Now you got people seriously claiming that $109,000 could have been the top for this cycle. Fuck all that. 

I love Bitcoin and I'm still holding, but I have to admit I'm disappointed that my first cycle is breaking all these norms to the downside. What shit luck class of 21' has!

What this means is that if indeed the aluminium tariffs promote (by design or otherwise) the repatriation of smelting capacity back to the United States, i.e., the building of new smelters on the mainland, which hasn't been done in 40 odd years, there will be more competition for the cheap power that the BTC miners currently exploit. I'm thinking, in particular, about some of the renewable 'excess' that the miners like to use.

In considering this potential headwind to profitable mining in the US, and what it may mean for the security of the blockchain, bear in mind it can take 8-10 years to get a smelter up and running.

Post,1jd4gna,Why would you need to wire money to play binary options?,DrumsBob,1742185330.0,"Everyone says she's a scammer as I suspected.  **How would she scam me?**

This woman I met online is trying to teach my how to make money trading crypto binary options.¬† She‚Äôs spent a LOT of time with me, as I‚Äôm a newbie.

She can‚Äôt be a scammer because everything is in my account, as far as I know.

She keeps saying she wires funds into her Coinbase account because you do better.¬† She said she has 2.6 million in assets, most likely a lot in her wallet or on Coinbase?

So why would she need to wire more funds?

She said: You are right. We can make a mobile transfer only after we get the details for the bank wire transfer in Coinbase. The information for the transfer needs to follow the wire transfer method provided in Coinbase. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

I still don't understand why she needs to wire with that much assets.?!?!?

¬†

She also said this:

Yes, my funds are all stored in my internal wallet account, not on the Coinbase exchange, because the exchange does not involve this type of derivative trading. Currently, my assets are approximately around 2.6 million dollars.

What I am about to guide you through is intraday binary options trading in both directions. This method leverages the short-term fluctuations of the market and trades based on the rise and fall of BTC to generate profits. Compared to long-term holding, this trading strategy is more flexible and allows for more opportunities in changing market conditions. Additionally, when we are not trading, the funds are safely stored in your personal account, unaffected by market volatility.

You are right. We can make a mobile transfer only after we get the details for the bank wire transfer in Coinbase. The information for the transfer needs to follow the wire transfer method provided in Coinbase. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

The principle is actually quite simple. For example, if I initially deposit $100,000 (via wire), after two transactions, my principal plus profits will be around $130,000. Similarly, as my savings principal and the number of transactions increase, my funds will gradually grow, eventually reaching the current amount. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

Even though I added both wallets, koinly logged my dates as short term gains and a couple thousand more in gains.   I knew that most of my sales were after more than a year of holding,  but seems the transfers were treated as if I had freshly acquired the assets. 

I decided to try coin tracker which turbotax integrates with.  Using that service it counted most gains as long term which aligned with what I thought. Sadly I had to pay for both services to learn this, but it just didn't seem right to be paying short term gains when I've held through a helluva lot.

Post,1jc33en,Cryptocurrency with automatically enforced redistribution of holdings?,EvanMcCormick,1742067104.0,"I had a loose idea that I wanted to throw out to you guys. The gist of it is that you have a crypto-currency in which there is some sort of registry for all of the people who use it, and at set intervals over time, the holdings of people who are on the registry are redistributed. Essentially, wealth redistribution hard-coded into the rules of the cryptocurrency. It wouldn't have to be too large, but generally a small amount which is perhaps graduated to become larger the more of the currency people hold on to.



So, for example, once every 24 hours, 0.005% of each person's current holdings is deducted and put into a big ole money pile, and then that pile is redistributed equally amongst all people in the registry.

My question is, mainly, is this technically feasible?

Post,1jbs1sw,How Inflation is Used as a Tool for Wealth Transfer and Population Control,worldtraveller321,1742033884.0,"**How Inflation is Used as a Tool for Wealth Transfer and Population Control**

# The Hidden Agenda Behind Inflation

Throughout history, inflation has been one of the most effective tools for wealth transfer from the general population to the elite. The ""powers that be"" understand this well and have continuously used the devaluation of fiat currency as a way to control and impoverish the masses. Venezuela serves as one of the most extreme modern examples, where hyperinflation devastated the economy, wiped out personal savings, and left people dependent on a crumbling government.

Could the United States be heading down the same path, with inflation being weaponized for population control? The signs are there.

# How Hyperinflation Benefits the Ultra-Wealthy

Inflation devalues fiat currency, making everyday essentials more expensive while wages stagnate. Those who hold real assets‚Äîsuch as land, gold, silver, and Bitcoin‚Äîcan weather the storm, while the majority of people, whose wealth is tied to the U.S. dollar, suffer immense losses.

The endgame? A scenario where:

* The average person is forced to sell off assets, including property and savings, just to survive.
* The ultra-wealthy swoop in to acquire these assets for pennies on the dollar.
* The general population becomes increasingly dependent on government aid, controlled services, and debt.

In essence, hyperinflation forces people into financial submission, while the elite accumulate real wealth at a discount.

# U.S. Government Strategy: A Two-Pronged Approach

The U.S. government appears to be moving in two conflicting directions:

1. **Printing Money Excessively**¬†‚Äì Trillions of dollars are being injected into the economy, further devaluing the U.S. dollar and increasing inflation. While this temporarily sustains the government and financial elites, it accelerates the collapse of purchasing power for the average citizen.
2. **Dismantling Government Services**¬†‚Äì Public services such as housing assistance, food subsidies, and social programs are being cut back, ensuring that fewer people can rely on the state while simultaneously making them financially vulnerable.

This double-edged policy forces the general population into hardship while allowing those in power to further consolidate control.

# The Silent Shift to Bitcoin: A New Financial Order?

One of the most overlooked developments in recent years is the U.S. government‚Äôs quiet accumulation of Bitcoin. While the general public is steered away from cryptocurrency‚Äîoften labeled as ‚Äútoo volatile‚Äù or ‚Äúfor criminals‚Äù‚Äîthe financial elite and government entities are securing digital assets behind the scenes.

If fiat currency collapses, Bitcoin and other decentralized assets could become the new foundation for financial power. But instead of transitioning everyone to this system, the government may choose to keep the masses trapped in a devalued U.S. dollar, ensuring that only the elite have access to the next-generation financial system.

# Why the General Public is Kept Away from Cryptocurrency

In recent years, the media and financial regulators have increasingly demonized cryptocurrency, especially Bitcoin. The narrative that crypto is only for the rich serves a purpose: to intimidate the average person from investing in an asset that could provide them financial freedom. By keeping people within the fiat system, dependent on a currency that is actively losing value, control over the population is maintained.

# The Warning from Early Crypto Enthusiasts

Years ago, early adopters of cryptocurrency warned about the coming financial shift. While some of these pioneers may now be part of the new financial elite, they did provide insights into what was necessary for people to maintain financial independence.

The question remains: Will people take control of their financial future, or will they allow themselves to be led into economic servitude?

# Final Thoughts: A Controlled Economic Collapse?

Is the U.S. deliberately pushing towards a financial collapse to enforce a new system where only the elite have access to real assets and alternative currencies? The playbook suggests that hyperinflation could be the ultimate weapon to transfer wealth and control the population.

The key to survival lies in owning assets that hold real value: gold, silver, land, and Bitcoin. As the dollar continues to lose its worth, those who have diversified into non-fiat assets will stand a chance of maintaining independence.
